Allow assigning automap types to 3D map events.

Export all kind of overviews and stats:
- All chests (contents, map, gold, food)
- All monsters (with relevant stats only)
- All monster groups (monsters, map) and battle events
- All party members (with relevant stats only and start equipment)
- All items you can get from NPCs
- All rewards regarding attributes, abilities and exp
- All potions and items granting attributes, abilities and spells
- Spell list with needed SP, SLP and damage


Revert SLP per Level adjustments. Spells stay as they are.
But Hero, Valdyn and Gryban still should have lower SLP, SP and max M-B.
As there are only very few Mystic spells, Valdyn should have really low SLP (1-2).
222 SLP are needed for all spells. The cool spells' SLP should be increased.

As Targor has very few spells he needs a good replacement.

An orb-like weapon which grants a few charges of Mystic Globe and has also:

Definitely remove all scrolls for the spells:

Remove the strenghten potions or replace them with a different item which grants Heal I and SP I?
