## Story

- Ancient temple covered in moss and with large stone pillars
- Many glass orbs tell the story of the temple
- You need the pickaxe to clear cave-ins
- You need the crowbar to open old doors (you get hints for that)
- You need lockpicks (or skill) to open most chests and even some doors (you get also hints)
- Swamp wasps will attack you
- Also some undeads wait for you in some central rooms
- There are poisonous puddles everywhere
- Large parts of the temple can change with levers/buttons
