## Todos

- test if huge lava messes up Amiga performance
- monsters
- spinners
- events
- you can slip through the double pillars (either use groups of 3 and 2 pillars alternating or make them bigger or place them to make the slit smaller but then also test on Amiga!)
- Does original show map object colors? Does remake not?
