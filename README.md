# Ambermoon-Advanced

## What it is

Ambermoon Advanced is an inofficial extension of Ambermoon. It is developed and maintained by me (Pyrdacor).

The first beta release 0.01 is out now in english and german.

Please keep in mind that this is in beta phase and I develop this on my own in my free time. So expect bugs, typos, bad texts, bad translations and even crashes. Save often!

Ambermoon Advanced is playable on the Amiga. At least I hope so. I tested it with WinUAE so I am not 100% sure if it runs on every Amiga hardware.

## What it's not

Ambermoon Advanced is no complete new game, so you will still play Ambermoon as you know it but of course with some additions and changes. For example monsters now have elements as well as spells. Therefore some monsters are now immune to certain spells. Don't bother shooting fire balls at fire dragons or rocks at stone golems. But there is no damage bonus against elements if you want to ask that.

Also keep in mind that adding content is a lot of work so don't expect the whole world to change or secrets in every dungeon. As Ambermoon Advanced is released in episodes the current changes focus on the early game and adds 2 new quest chains to the mid to late game on Lyramion.

If you want to play the episodes in succession you should pause before you leave Lyramion for the first time. The second episode is planned for the late game on Lyramion. Other episodes will then focus on the forest moon and Morag.
