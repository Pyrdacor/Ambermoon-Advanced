# Ambermoon-Advanced

This project will be the first Mod for Ambermoon.

It focuses on the following things:
- Balance the game (characters, spells, monsters, item placement and amount, etc)
  - For example making some characters more valuable like Selena, Leonaria or Targor
  - Avoid obsolete things like rations/food dealers, blacksmiths, sages, ropes, finding/disarming traps, search skill, etc by making them useful again
- Add new content
  - Quests
  - Places (especially on the two moons and useless islands)
  - Items
  - Monsters
  - NPCs
- Breaking bugfixes
  - There are bugs in original Ambermoon that fixing them would change the game experience. For example spell/monster elements. They were part of Ambermoon but because of a bug they did not work or not as they were intended.

As the game is an extension of the original game, it should also be playable on the Amiga. So this Mod will mostly add things that can be added through data and not code changes. So there will be no new fancy windows or completely new game features.

This also means that the game size has to be kept quiet low. So don't expect huge new graphics etc. Visual changes might be mostly done through different palettes.


My exact plans are not revealed yet. ;) But I promise it will be a cool addition.

Along the way I will create or improve tools to edit the game data so everyone who plans to create mods should benefit.


Stay tuned!
