# Ambermoon-Advanced

## What it is

Ambermoon Advanced is an inofficial extension of Ambermoon. It is developed and maintained by me (Pyrdacor).

The first official release 1.02 is out now in english and german. It contains the first two episodes "Mysteries of the sea" and "Elemental creatures". Five episodes are planned in total.

Please keep in mind that I develop this on my own in my free time. So expect bugs, typos, bad texts, bad translations, unbalanced sections, dead ends and even crashes. Save often! If you get stuck of find bugs, please get in touch here on GitHub in the issue tracker or via mail (trobt@web.de).

Ambermoon Advanced is playable on the Amiga. At least I hope so. I tested it with WinUAE so I am not 100% sure if it runs flawlessly on every Amiga hardware.


## What it's not

Ambermoon Advanced is no complete new game, so you will still play Ambermoon as you know it but of course with some additions and changes. For example monsters now have elements and spells have elements too. Therefore some monsters are now immune to certain spells. Don't bother shooting fire balls at fire dragons or rocks at stone golems. In the second episode elemental spells will also have increase or reduced damage against specific elemental monsters. Moreover spell damage is then increased by intelligence and level.

Also keep in mind that adding content is a lot of work so don't expect the whole world to change or secrets in every dungeon. As Ambermoon Advanced is released in episodes the current changes focus on the early to late game on Lyramion. The two moons have no new content so far. This will change in the next episodes of course.

If you want to play the episodes in succession you should pause before you leave Lyramion for the first time.


## Prepare for the second episode

The second episode is out now. Unfortunately it wasn't possible to keep the savegames compatible with the ones from the first episode. However there is a savegame patcher online which you can use to patch your savegame to use it for the second episode. You can find it online at https://ambermoon-advanced.pyrdacor.net. Just drag&drop your savegame folders (e.g. Save.00) there and you will be able to
download the patched version as a zip file.

If you use the remake Ambermoon.net you don't need to do this as the remake automatically upgrades your savegames on loading.

Note: **The patched savegames might be incompatible when playing the first episode with them.**

Note: **Always backup your saves beforehand!**

Note: **The patcher only works with Ambermoon Advanced savegames. Don't use original savegames!**


## Game manual

As a little surprise I created a real physical manual for Ambermoon Advanced which can be ordered and printed on demand. Unfortunately it is still in the preparation phase. I will inform you if it is available.

It will contain many information about the changes but also has some valuable information of Ambermoon in general. For example detailed descriptions of conditions, attributes and skills which was lacking from the original manual. And it contains a small version of the original world map and rune table. Especially useful for people who don't possess the original box.

It also contains the element damage table and the complete spell book with SP and SLP costs, spell effect descriptions and so on. The SP and SLP values might differ from the original though.

I also bought a few illustrations to make the manual a bit nicer so that it isn't just a boring piece of paper.

The manual will cost a bit. Basically the price will cover the production and illustration costs, print service fee and the rest is some kind of project support. In the end I will get around 2-3 euros per sold manual and you get a nice little illustrated book. Don't expect too much, I am neither an artist nor a writer. ;) But I thought this would be a cool idea.

## FAQ

- Where can I find the disk images?

  Unfortunately at the current state there are none. The problem is that the new content is huge and the data won't fit onto the original 9+1 disks anymore. I invented some new compression algorithms but it still does not fit yet. I will try to make it possible later.

- How to play it on the Amiga?

  Well basically the archives contain all the files like if you would install the game on a HDD. So just copy all the files into a folder on your Amiga HDD and start the game by clicking the Ambermoon icon in the root folder.

- How to play on modern systems like Windows, Linux or Mac?

  Just head over to https://github.com/Pyrdacor/Ambermoon.net and check the downloads there. The remake contains the most recent version of Ambermoon Advanced as well. You can select it when you start the game.
