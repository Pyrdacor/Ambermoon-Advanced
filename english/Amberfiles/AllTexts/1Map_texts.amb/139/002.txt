NOTHING HAPPENS AS YOU APPROACH THE COORDINATES FROM TORLE'S JOURNAL. THE SEA IS RELATIVELY CALM AND A FEW SEAGULLS ARE FLYING AROUND. BUT AFTER A WHILE YOUR SHIP STARTS SHAKING. AND THEN SUDDENLY THE SHELL OF A GIANT TURTLE BREAKS THROUGH THE WATER'S SURFACE NOT FAR FROM YOU. IT IS BIGGER THAN THREE SHIPS AND ITS APPEARANCE EMITS HUGE WAVES.^^ "GREETINGS." SAYS THE ENORMOUS ANIMAL. SURPRISED YOU RUN TO THE FRONT RAIL.^^ "WE, THE SAGES OF THE SEA, WON'T REVEAL OURSELVES TO EVERYONE. BUT LYRAMION AND ITS OCEANS ARE IN GREAT DANGER. I AM URLA, ONE OF THE FIVE SAGES OF THE SEA. I CAN TELL THAT YOU HAVE A PURE HEART. THAT'S WHY I'LL GIVE YOU MY BLESSINGS. FIND ALL OF US AND THEN VISIT THE OCEAN QUEEN. SHE WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY IF YOU HAVE ALL OF OUR BLESSINGS."^^ WITH THESE WORDS THE BEAST DIVES BACK INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN.
