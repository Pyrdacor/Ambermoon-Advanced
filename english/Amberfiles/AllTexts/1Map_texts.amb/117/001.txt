AS ISDIR PREDICTED A HORRID BEAST SUDDENLY APPEARS NOT FAR FROM THE TREE. UPON NOTICING YOU, IT BRIEFLY REMAINS STANDING IN DISBELIEF. BUT INSTEAD OF ATTACKING YOU, IT BEGINS TO SPEAK WITH YOU:^^ "IT IS RARE THAT PEOPLE DO NOT IMMEDIATELY FLEE AT THE SIGHT OF ME. YOU MUST BE A BRAVE GROUP. I WAS ONCE A NORMAL FARMER, CULTIVATING MY FIELDS AND DRIVING MY LIVESTOCK OUT TO PASTURE ON THESE PLAINS. BUT ONE DAY, A STRANGE MAN CAME HERE. HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF AS MARMION AND DEMANDED THAT I GIVE HIM ALL MY COWS. OF COURSE, I REFUSED HIM AND SO HE CURSED ME AND GAVE ME THIS GHLASTY APPEARANCE. SINCE THEN, I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO HIDE. I HAD TO GIVE UP MY FARM AND THE GREAT FLOOD DID THE REST. FOR DECADES, I HAVE WANDERED HERE AIMLESSLY, WITH NO GOAL OR PERSPECTIVE. THE CURSE STILL WEIGHS ON ME AND THE ONLY WAY OUT IS DEATH AT THE HANDS OF A BRAVE HERO. UNFORTUNATELY, NO ONE HAS YET HAD THE COURAGE TO FACE ME. PLEASE GRANT ME THIS MERCY, OR I WILL BE FORCED TO SHOW YOU NO MERCY."^^ WITH THESE WORDS, HE APPROACHES YOU.
