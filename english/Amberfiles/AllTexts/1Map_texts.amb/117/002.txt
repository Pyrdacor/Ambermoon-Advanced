"THANK YOU, NOBLE ADVENTURERS. MY SOUL CAN NOW REST IN PEACE AND LEAVE THIS PLACE OF TERRIBLE MEMORIES. IN GRATITUDE, YOU SHOULD DIG A LITTLE ON MY OLD FIELD, LOCATED NORTH OF HERE. I HID SOMETHING THERE THAT WAS VERY DEAR TO ME."^^ WITH THESE WORDS, THE BEAST'S RASPING BODY DISSOLVES AND BLUE WISPS RISE TOWARDS THE SKY.
