AS YOU TAKE THE FIRE CRYSTAL OUT OF YOUR POCKET, IT SUDDENLY STARTS TO GLOW. IT BURNS ~INVN~'S FINGERS SLIGHTLY, AND THE PAIN-FILLED HAND DROPS IT HASTILY TO THE GROUND. BRIGHT LIGHT EMANATES FROM THE UNUSUAL OBJECT IN ALL DIRECTIONS, AND YOU MUST SHIELD YOUR EYES TO AVOID BLINDING YOURSELF. AFTER A FEW SECONDS, THE CRYSTAL DISAPPEARS AND A MIGHTY ROAR ECHOES THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS TO THE NORTH OF YOU. LARGE ROCKS MOVE, AND A CAVE ENTRANCE OPENS UP DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOU.
