AS YOU PULL THE FIRE CRYSTAL OUT OF YOUR POCKET, IT BEGINS TO GLOW SUDDENLY. IT BURNS YOUR HAND LIGHTLY AND YOU DROP IT HASTY TO THE GROUND. BRIGHT LIGHT RADIATES FROM THE UNUSUAL OBJECT IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND YOU MUST COVER YOUR EYES TO AVOID BEING BLINDED. AFTER A FEW SECONDS, THE CRYSTAL DISAPPEARS AND A MIGHTY ROAR RESONATES THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS NORTH OF YOU. LARGE ROCKS MOVE AND A CAVE ENTRANCE OPENS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOU.
