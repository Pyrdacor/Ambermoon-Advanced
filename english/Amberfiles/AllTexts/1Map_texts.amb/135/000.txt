A THREATFUL AND BLAZING FAST SHADOW SUDDENLY APPEARS BENEATH THE SHIP. IT MOVES AROUND YOU IN DECREASING CIRCLES UNTIL IT EVENTUALLY JUMPS OUT OF THE WATER AND YOU SEE THAT IT IS ACTUALLY A GIANT PIRANHA. IT JUMPS ACROSS THE WHOLE SHIP AND DIVES INTO THE OCEAN ON THE OTHER SIDE. TENSELY ALL OF YOU STARE AT THE WATER SURFACE BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. YOU WAIT FOR A WHILE AND JUST WANT TO SAIL ON, WHEN THE PIRANHA APPEARS ONCE AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME IN FRONT OF THE BOW.^^ "YOU ARE SOME PATIENT CREATURES. THIS IS REMARKABLE. I AM HONSHU, ONE OF THE FIVE SAGES OF THE SEA AND HEREBY I GIVE YOU MY BLESSINGS. FIGHT OFF THE EVIL FORCES WHICH THREATEN OUR OCEANS. FIND ALL OF US AND THEN GO TO THE OCEAN QUEEN. WE NEED YOUR HELP. LYRAMION'S SEAS ARE IN GREAT DANGER."
