AS ~LEAD~ TOUCHES THE CRYSTAL, A VOICE ECHOES IN YOUR HEADS. ONLY A FEW PHRASES ARE UNDERSTANDABLE:^^ "GOLDEN WATER... PRECIOUS..."^ "MUST CREATE..."^^ "FIERY PLANT... AT WITCH'S HOUSE..."^ "GOLDEN SCALE... BURNVILLE..."^ "WATER... LIFE..."^ "UNITE... LEBAB..."^^AFTERWARDS, IT IS QUIET AGAIN IN THE CAVE. ONLY A SOFT SPLASHING SOUND CAN STILL BE HEARD.
