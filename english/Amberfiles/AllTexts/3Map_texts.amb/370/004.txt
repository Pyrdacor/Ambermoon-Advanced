THE MERMAID FLOATS JUST IN FRONT OF YOU IN THE WATER: "FROM HERE ON YOU HAVE TO SWIM. THE SANDY GROUND IN THIS CAVE HIDES SOME VALUABLE THINGS. UNFORTUNATELY THE WIND HAS BURRIED MOST OF IT UNDER THICK LAYERS OF SAND. BUT WITH THE RIGHT TOOL YOU MIGHT REVEAL A FEW OF THOSE TREASURES.^^IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE THIS PLACE, JUST HOLD ONTO MY SHOULDERS AND I WILL BRING YOU BACK TO THE SURFACE."
