THE ELVEN WOMAN IS SUPRISED AS SHE SEES YOU: "YOU ARE NEW IN CAVETOWN. I CAME HERE MANY YEARS AGO. MY SHIP SANK NOT FAR FROM THE WHIRLPOOL. I AM ACTUALLY A PRINCESS OF THE ELVES AND SHOULD BE FORCED TO MARRY SOME HUMAN. BUT LUCKILY THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN. MOST OF THE MALE HUMANS ARE OF NO USE. TAKE OUR TOWN ADMINISTRATOR TRISTAN FOR EXAMPLE. JUST WHEN THERE IS SOME TROUBLE AT THE HORIZON, HE STARTS DRINKING. ONLY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO TOURIST HERE IN A FEW DECADES. YOU CAN FIND THIS PATHETIC FAILURE IN THE TAVERN EAST OF CAVETOWN."
