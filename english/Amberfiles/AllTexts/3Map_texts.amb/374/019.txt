THE OLD MAN TALKS TO YOU ABOUT CAVETOWN AND WHY IT IS SO GOOD FOR ATTRACTING TOURISTS: "ALL MY LIFE I LIVED INSIDE THIS CAVE. AFTER LEAVING SHIP'S END WE FOUNDED THIS CITY AROUND THE CASTLE. ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL? THE CASTLE ONCE WAS OCCUPIED BY A CRUEL MONSTER CALLED MANYEYES. MANY OF THE VILLAGE PEOPLE DISAPPEARED BACK THEN AND MOST LIKELY WERE EATEN ALIVE BY THE BEAST. BUT DON'T WORRY, MANYEYES WAS KILLED AGES AGO. SINCE THEN WE LIVE IN PEACE HERE. FEEL FREE TO EXPLORE OUR BEAUTIFUL TOWN."
