THE INNKEEPER SAYS:^ "WELCOME TO THE INN OF THE SLEEPING EYE. IF YOU NEED A ROOM, PLEASE GO TO THE RECEPTION DESK NEXT TO THE SOUTH ENTRANCE. IF YOU ARE THIRSTY, COME TO THE BAR ON THE LEFT. I ALSO SELL MY SPECIALTY, BLIND BRANDY. IT LIVES UP TO ITS NAME. YOU WON'T GO BLIND, BUT NORMAL VISION IS NOT GUARANTEED AFTERWARDS. SO ENJOY WITH CAUTION. IF YOU ARE HUNGRY, COME TO THE BAR ON THE RIGHT."
