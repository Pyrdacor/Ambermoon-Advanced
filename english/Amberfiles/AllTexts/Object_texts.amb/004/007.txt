MYSTIC CREATURES^^ AT LEAST SIX MYSTIC CREATURES WITH IMMENSE POWER ARE KNOWN TO THE PALADINS OF CRYSTAL.^^ISDIR, THE NOBLE WATER ELEMENTAL AND MASTER OF THE ETERNAL ICE. ACCORDING TO LEGEND, HE ONCE LIVED IN THE GREAT VORTEX. BUT AS WATER IS A TRANSITORY ENTITY, SO IS HE.^^PYRDACOR, THE FIRE DRAGON AND LORD OF THE BLACK MOUNTAINS. ONE CAN SEE THE RAGE OF PYRDACOR FROM TWINLAKE, WHEN DARK CLOUDS OF SMOKE RISE FROM THE WESTERN MOUNTAINS OR EVEN STREAMS OF LAVA FLOW OUT OF THEM. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHIEF OF TWINLAKE TO BESOOTHE THE DRAGON. EACH BARON PASSES THIS LIABILITY DOWN TO HIS SUCCESSOR.^^MARLA, THE MOTHER OF EARTH AND GUARDIAN OF THE SIGHING DESERT. SOME SAY SHE IS THE SAND ITSELF BELOW YOUR FEETS. TRAVELLERS REPORTED HOW THE DESERT GROUND SUDDENLY OPENED AND SWALLOWED WHOLE GROUPS OF PEOPLE. THEY WERE SURE: THIS COULD ONLY BE MARLA.^^LUGTHIR, THE MIGHTY EAGLE AND LORD OF THE WINDS. SINCE EONS OF TIME THE EAGLES PROTECT THE LYRAMION SKIES. LUGTHIR'S SOUL WAS PRESERVED IN THE EYRIE AFTER HIS DEATH. PELANIS, HEAD OF THE ELVES, GUARDS THE KEY TO THE EYRIE.^^FARGON, THE STRONGEST WARRIOR OF THE UNDEAD ARMY. A MIGHTY BUT VICIOUS FIGHTER, WHO MADE THE PALADIN'S LIVES DIFFICULT SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. FORTUNATELY THE HOLY GUNBAR, MOST POWERFUL PALADIN OF THEM ALL, COULD STRIKE HIM DOWN EVENTUALLY. HOWEVER HE ALSO LOST HIS LIFE DURING THE BATTLE. FARGON'S ESSENCE WAS ISOLATED AND STORED IN A HEAVY IRON CHEST IN THE GUILD OF PALADINS. NO OTHER PLACE WOULD PROVIDE A BETTER GUARDIANSHIP.^^GUNBAR, MASTER OF THE PALADINS. LIKELY THE MIGHTIEST PALADIN WHO EVER LIVED. HE FREED LYRAMION FROM FARGON, THE UNDEAD WARRIOR AND WAS EVER SINCE WORSHIPPED BY ALL PALADINS. HIS SOUL WAS TRANSFERRED INTO A LARGE STATUE SO THAT HIS POWER CAN PROTECT THE GUILD.
