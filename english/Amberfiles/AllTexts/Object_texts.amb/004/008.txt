ALTAR OF KNOWLEDGE^^ THE PALADIN GUILD GUARDS A VERY VALUABLE ALTAR. ONLY SELECTED MEMBERS ARE ALLOWED TO USE IT. THE HOLY RELIC HAS THE ABILITY TO EXCHANGE THE TOTAL LIFE EXPERIENCE OF TWO PEOPLE. MANY YOUNGER PALADINS WERE ABLE TO USE THE EXPERIENCE OF OLD WARRIORS IN TIMES OF WAR AND BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN BATTLE.^^ AS A CATALYST, A TRANSFER STONE IS USED. IF A PERSON USES SUCH A STONE, THEY CAN CHOOSE WITH WHOM THEY WISH TO EXCHANGE EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, THE STONES ARE RARE AND ARE DESTROYED DURING TRANSFER. THE ALTAR HAS THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE NEW STONES, BUT FOR THAT A STONE OF KNOWLEDGE IS NEEDED. ONLY LIVING HIGHER BEINGS ARE ABLE TO TRANSFER. ATTEMPTING A TRANSFER WITH A DEAD HUMAN OR EVEN AN ANIMAL WILL DESTROY THE STONE POINTLESSLY.
