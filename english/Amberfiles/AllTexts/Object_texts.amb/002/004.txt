LEONARIA'S JOURNAL IS WRITTEN IN BEAUTIFUL HANDWRITING. MANY ENTRIES DETAIL HER STUDY OF ALCHEMY AND HER PAST ADVENTURES. AT THE END, THERE IS A PAGE WHERE THE INK HAS NOT FULLY DRIED.^^ "TODAY, I FINALLY RECEIVED A CRUCIAL CLUE ABOUT THE FORGOTTEN TEMPLE FROM AN ELF IN ILLIEN. APPARENTLY, IT IS SAID TO BE LOCATED IN THE GRAL SWAMPS WEST OF SANSRI'S ISLE. MY NEXT DESTINATION IS THE VILLAGE OF SNAKESIGN. PERHAPS I CAN FIND SOMEONE THERE WHO KNOWS THE TEMPLE'S ENTRANCE. I HOPE TO FINALLY DISCOVER POWERFUL ALCHEMICAL SPELLS THERE, JUST AS THE LEGEND SAYS. IF ONLY I COULD JOIN A GROUP. THIS UNDERTAKING MIGHT PROVE DIFFICULT ALONE, ESPECIALLY SINCE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT DANGERS AWAIT ME INSIDE THE TEMPLE."
