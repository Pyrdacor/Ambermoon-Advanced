THE TOWER ONLY APPEARS AFTER A TRIAL.^2. THE BUILDER OF THE TOWER WAS A CERTAIN THAL.^3. THREE LOCATIONS MUST BE VISITED.^3.1. FIRST, A SMALL POND WEST OF THE ELVES.^3.2. THEN, SOUTHEAST OF THERE, AN OLD TREE.^3.3. FINALLY, ROCKS TO THE SOUTH ON THE SAME ISLAND.^^THEN, THE TOWER SHOULD REVEAL ITSELF."
