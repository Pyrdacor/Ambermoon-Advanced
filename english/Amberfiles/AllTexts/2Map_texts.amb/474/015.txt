AFTER THE FIGHT, MARLA AND HER GOLEMS DISSOLVE INTO SAND AGAIN AND MERGE WITH THE EARTH. AT THE END OF THE ROOM, YOU SEE AN HOURGLASS. SUDDENLY, MARLA WHISPERS: "THIS IS THE ALTAR OF ETERNAL SANDS. SKILLED MAGICIANS CAN TOUCH IT TO STRENGTHEN THE POWER OF THEIR EARTH SPELLS. SINCE YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WORTHY, I LEAVE MY ESSENCE TO YOU AND ALLOW YOU TO USE THIS HOLY RELIC."
