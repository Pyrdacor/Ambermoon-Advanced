AS YOU ENTER THE ROOM, YOU NOTICE A STRANGE FOUNTAIN FROM WHICH BLUE FUMES ARE RISING. "NICE, ISN'T IT?" SUDDENLY, PYRDACOR APPEARS IN FRONT OF YOU AGAIN. "THIS IS THE FOUNTAIN OF KNOWLEDGE. THE FIRE OF THIS MOUNTAIN REPRESENTS KNOWLEDGE, DYNAMICS, AND DEVELOPMENT. ANYONE IN POSSESSION OF A WISHING COIN CAN GAIN EXPERIENCE HERE. BUT I ONLY ALLOW WORTHY ADVENTURERS TO THE HOLY SOURCE." WITH THESE WORDS, HE RAISES HIS ARMS AND TWO LAVA DRAGONS APPEAR NEXT TO HIM.
