THIS CAVE WAS DUG FOR YOU BY THEODORUS. IT LOOKS PRETTY SMALL AND REALLY ONLY CONSISTS OF A SMALL TUNNEL. PERHAPS HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE DIGGING ANY FURTHER? IT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR A STORE ROOM OR SIMILAR.^^ DISAPPOINTED, YOU ARE ABOUT TO LEAVE THE CAVE AGAIN WHEN YOU NOTICE A LARGE HOLE IN THE GROUND AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE ENOUGH ROPES WITH YOU TO GET BACK UP AGAIN.
