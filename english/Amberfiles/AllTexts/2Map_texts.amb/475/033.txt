AFTER A HARD BATTLE, DIOKHAR COLLAPSES WITH A GROAN.^^ "FORGIVE MY ARROGANCE. THANKS TO YOU, I FINALLY UNDERSTAND THAT I WASN'T POWERFUL ENOUGH. I SHOULD HAVE INVESTED MY TIME IN THE ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE, INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR AN EASY WAY. EVEN IF THIS REALIZATION COMES TOO LATE, MY SOUL CAN NOW ENTER BALA'S REALM IN PEACE. WITH MY REMAINING STRENGTH, I WILL OPEN A PATH FOR YOU. YOU MUST KNOW, THIS TEMPLE EXISTED LONG BEFORE ME, AND A GREAT TREASURE IS HIDDEN HERE."^^ WITH HIS LAST STRENGTH, DIOKHAR RAISES HIS ARM ONCE MORE, AND YOU HEAR A LOUD SOUND BEHIND YOU. STARTLED, YOU TURN AROUND, EXPECTING AN AMBUSH. BUT IT SEEMS A PASSAGEWAY HAS ACTUALLY OPENED. WHEN YOU TURN BACK TO THE ALCHEMIST, HE HAS ALREADY LEFT THE MORTAL WORLD.
