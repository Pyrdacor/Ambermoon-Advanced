"IT'S NICE THAT YOU'VE LISTENED TO MY STORY. I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU ALL THIS TIME AND LED YOU TO ME WITH THE HELP OF THE GLASS BALLS. THANKS TO YOU, I AM ALIVE AGAIN AND STRONGER THAN EVER. MY NAME IS DIOKHAR, AND THIS IS NOW MY TEMPLE."^^ WITH THESE WORDS, A YOUNG MAN IN A WORN ROBE EMERGES FROM THE COFFIN. CALMLY, THE ALCHEMIST SWINGS A LONG STAFF, AT THE TIP OF WHICH SITS A WHITE GLASS BALL. EVEN IN THIS SPHERE, A STRANGE GHOSTLY MIST SWIRLS.^^ "CAPTURED UNDEAD SOULS," DIOKHAR WHISPERS TO YOU AS HE NOTICES YOU EXAMINING HIS STAFF. "THEY HAVE BEEN WAITING EAGERLY FOR THEIR RELEASE. AND NOW I AM FINALLY ABLE TO SET THEM FREE!"^^ WITH THESE WORDS, HE UNLEASHES A STREAM OF UNDEAD SPIRITS FROM HIS STAFF.
