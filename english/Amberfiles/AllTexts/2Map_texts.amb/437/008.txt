AS YOU LAND THE AIRSHIP ON MORAG, THE DOOR OPENS AND A STRANGE FIGURE ENTERS.^^ "I GREET YOU, ADVENTURERS. MY NAME IS ROBERT AND I AM THE DEVELOPER OF THIS EXPANSION. HERE ON MORAG, NEW CONTENT WILL BE RELEASED IN THE FUTURE. SO IT'S BEST TO SAVE YOUR GAME. OF COURSE, YOU'RE WELCOME TO PROCEED AND EXPLORE MORAG. ENJOY YOUR TIME WITH AMBERMOON ADVANCED."^^ WITH THESE WORDS, THE FIGURE HURRIES BACK TO THE DOOR AND DISAPPEARS.
