AS YOU APPROACH THE SHADOWY FIGURE, IT GLANCES UP AT YOU. "WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING BY INTRUDING INTO MY KINGDOM? I AM PYRDACOR, THE GUARDIAN OF THIS PLACE. USUALLY I WOULD HAVE BURNED YOU DOWN TO THE BONES ALREADY, BUT YOU LOOK LIKE CAPABLE ADVENTURERS AND I LOVE PUZZLES. SO IF YOU SOLVE MY PUZZLES, I MIGHT LET YOU LIVE. NOW PROCEED FORWARD AND FIND THE NUMBER ON THE MAP." WITH THESE WORDS, THE FIGURE DISSOLVES INTO SMOKE AGAIN.
