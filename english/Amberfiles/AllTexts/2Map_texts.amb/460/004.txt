IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM, YOU FIND SOME PIECES OF CLOTHING. YOU IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE THE CLOTHING OF GUSTAV, THE APPRENTICE. APPARENTLY, THE SPIDER BITE THAT GUSTAV REPORTED HAD LEFT TRACES ON THEODORUS. HE PROBABLY ONLY TEMPORARILY SUPPRESSED THE TRANSFORMATION INTO THE LARGE SPIDER. NO WONDER HE HAD MAINLY WANTED TO BUILD CELLARS AND CAVES LATELY AND PREFERRED THE DARKNESS. LUCKILY, THAT IS NOW OVER. BUT THE GROUP ALSO KNOWS THAT POOR GUSTAV ULTIMATELY FELL VICTIM TO HIS OLD MASTER. YOU PAUSE BRIEFLY IN MEMORY AND JUST AS YOU ARE ABOUT TO TURN AWAY, ~LEAD~ NOTICES SOMETHING GLITTERING UNDER THE REMAINS OF THE CLOTHING.
