"YOU WERE IN THE PALADIN GUILD IN CRYSTAL? THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE! THE CITY FELL VICTIM TO THE IMPACT OF THE RED EYE TARBOS AND THE GREAT FLOOD."^^ ~INK 30~ AFTER RELATING IN DETAIL ABOUT THE OLD WINE CELLAR AND THE REMAINS OF THE OLD GUILD, HE SAYS:^^ ~INK 31~ "WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT? A WONDERFUL STORY! I SHOULDN'T REALLY DO THIS, BUT THE MOUNTAIN HAS BEEN QUIET FOR A LONG TIME AND FOR SOME REASON I TRUST YOU. HERE IS THE OBJECT THAT CAN OPEN THE BLACK MOUNTAINS. JUST PLACE YOURSELF IN FRONT OF THE SOUTHERNMOST MOUNTAIN RANGE AND USE THIS CRYSTAL, AND THE WAY SHOULD BE OPEN TO YOU. THE MOUNTAINS ARE WEST OF HERE. OH, I ALMOST FORGOT ONE THING. THE CRYSTAL HAS NOT BEEN USED FOR DECADES AND HAS CERTAINLY LOST ITS POWER. OLD LEBAB SHOULD BE ABLE TO HELP YOU, THOUGH."
