"THE PALADINS OF CRYSTAL WERE RESPECTED BRAVE WARRIORS IN THE SERVICE OF LIGHT. I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO HAVE A HANDFUL OF THEM AMONG MY TROOPS. I COULD FREE THE CRYPT FROM ALL EVIL SPIRITS AND FINALLY MAKE AN END TO THIS WEIRD BROTHERHOOD. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ALL DIED IN THE GREAT FLOOD. WHAT A PITY!"
