"INTERESTING. THIS CRYSTAL SEEMS TO POSSESS GREAT MAGICAL POWERS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, ITS STRENGTH IS ALREADY QUITE EXHAUSTED. I WILL NOW TRY TO STRENGTHEN IT." ^^ SHEERA RUNS HER HAND OVER THE STRANGE CRYSTAL A FEW TIMES AND MURMURS SOME FELINE INCANTATIONS. SUDDENLY, AN ORANGE LIGHT EMERGES FROM WITHIN THE FRAGMENT.^^ "IT NOW HAS A LITTLE MORE POWER, BUT IT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO REACTIVATE THE PORTAL. PERHAPS YOU CAN CONTINUE EXPLORING THE CAVE AND BRING ME MORE TRIIS. TEN PIECES MIGHT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO STABILISE THE PORTAL."
