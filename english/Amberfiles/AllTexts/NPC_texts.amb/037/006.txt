~INK 30~ UPON TELLING THEODORUS THAT YOU MET HIS APPRENTICE, YOU THINK YOU NOTICE A BRIEF TWINKLE IN HIS GAZE.^^ ~INK 31~ "SO, YOU'VE FOUND MY FORMER APPRENTICE, HAVE YOU? IN FACT, I CAN BUILD THE RARE WIND GATES, FOR I AM THE DESCENDANT OF THE GREAT THEODORUS BARGUND, WHO INVENTED AND BUILT THE WIND GATES. THAT KNOWLEDGE HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. I'LL OFFER YOU A DEAL. I'LL BUILD A WIND GATE FOR YOU AND ONLY CHARGE A VERY LOW PRICE FOR IT. BUT IN RETURN, I GET TO USE THE WIND GATE TO TRAVEL TO SNAKESIGN. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MY APPRENTICE AGAIN. FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE. HE DISAPPEARED SO SUDDENLY BACK THEN THAT I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO SAY GOODBYE. AFTER MY RETURN, I COULD THEN DIG A STORAGE CAVE FOR YOU TOO, IF YOU LIKE. THAT'S BEEN MY SPECIALTY FOR A FEW YEARS NOW."
