SANDRA ACCEPTS THE BROOCH AND EXAMINES IT ASTONISHED FROM ALL SIDES FOR A TIME. "THIS BROOCH BELONGED TO ME WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL. BUT ONE DAY I LOST IT WHILE VISITING THE CITY OF CRYSTAL. THE POWERFUL SHANDRA HIMSELF GAVE IT TO ME. YOU MUST KNOW THAT THE BROOCH POSSESSES MAGICAL POWERS THAT ONLY I KNOW HOW TO USE PROPERLY. IT CAN TRANSFER THE ESSENCES OF DECEASED BEINGS INTO AN ANIMAL. BACK THEN, I COULD COMMUNICATE WITH MY BELOVED GRANDFATHER BY HAVING HIM BECOME A PART OF MY TOMCAT FELIX."^^ SHE PAUSES FOR A MOMENT TO THINK.^^ "THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE BEING CAN BE TRANSFERRED. THEREFORE, A TRANSFER WITH NORMAL DECEASED BEINGS IS USUALLY NOT WORTH IT. HOWEVER, IF YOU POSSESS THE ESSENCES OF VERY POWERFUL BEINGS, IT COULD BE POSSIBLE TO TRANSFER ENOUGH POWER INTO AN ANIMAL TO MAKE IT STRONGER. NOW THAT I HAVE MY BROOCH AGAIN, I COULD PERFORM SUCH A TRANSFER FOR YOU. I ONLY NEED A SUITABLE ESSENCE AND, OF COURSE, AN ANIMAL THAT SHOULD RECEIVE THE ESSENCE."
