SANDRA TAKES THE ESSENCE AND MUTTERS A FEW SPELLS. COLORFUL WISPS STREAM FROM THE ESSENCE INTO HER BROOCH AND FROM THERE INTO KASIMIR'S FOREHEAD. HE CLOSES HIS EYES PAINFULLY AND THEN BECOMES COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS. BUT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN NEW ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH HIS BODY AND HE WAKES UP. HIS GAZE IS NOW MUCH CLEARER AND YOU GET THE FEELING THAT HE HAS BECOME MORE MATURE AND STRONGER.^^ SANDRA LOWERS HER ARMS AND SAYS, "KEEP THE REST OF THE ESSENCE. I CAN NO LONGER PERFORM A TRANSFER WITH IT, BUT IT STILL CONTAINS SOME POWERFUL SPELLS."
