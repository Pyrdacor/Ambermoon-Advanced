"THANK YOU FOR DEALING WITH THE KNIGHTS. NOW I CAN FINALLY HAVE A LOOK AROUND IN PEACE. AS A THANK YOU, I ALLOW YOU TO TAKE THE HIGHEST THIEVES' TEST IF YOU EVER RETURN TO SPANNENBERG. JUST COME TO THE CELLAR OF THE TAVERN. YOU'LL FIND ME THERE."^^ WITH THESE WORDS, AMAN VANISHES INTO THE SHADOWS OF THE ARMORY.
