"I CAN'T SEEM TO GET ALONG WITH MERA'S SON, BECAUSE HE HATES CATS. HE KICKED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE WHERE I'VE ALWAYS LIVED. I DID SLASH MY CLAWS ACROSS HIS FACE, BUT HE TOOK REVENGE AND BURNED OFF MY HALF TAIL. I WILL TELL YOU WHERE HIS SECRET HIDEOUT IS. THAT WAY I CAN MAKE HIM PAY FOR MY TAIL. JUST TOUCH THE WALL IN THE CELLAR SOUTH OF THE STAIRS."
