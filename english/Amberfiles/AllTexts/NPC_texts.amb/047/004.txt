"IN MY FAMILY, A LEGEND HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN ABOUT THE FAMOUS MELVIN. ONE EVENING, HE IS SAID TO HAVE SEEN A GHOST IN THE SWAMPS WHO WHISPERED THE WORD 'GRAL.' AFTER THAT, A GATE OPENED IN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE NORTH OF THE SWAMP, AND THE GHOST VANISHED INTO IT. AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT OLD MELVIN TOLD HIS CHILDREN. BUT IT'S PROBABLY JUST A MADE-UP SPOOKY STORY.^^ HOWEVER, I CAN SEE FROM YOUR LOOK THAT YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING IN THE GRAL SWAMPS. THEY ARE LOCATED NORTHWEST OF HERE, BEYOND THIS ISLAND. BE CAREFUL WITH THE MUDDY GROUND. IT'S FULL OF POISONOUS ANIMALS AND PLANTS.^^ ACCORDING TO THE LEGEND, YOU MUST SAY THE WORD 'GRAL' AT NIGHT, SOMEWHERE ALONG A NORTHERN FLANK OF THE MOUNTAIN RANGE OF THE SWAMP."
