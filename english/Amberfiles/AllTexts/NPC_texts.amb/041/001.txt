"I'M NOT IN THE MOOD TO TALK TO YOU. HOWEVER, YOU SEEM NEW HERE."^^ ~INK 30~ FOR A SHORT TIME, THE MAN'S GAZE BRIGHTENS.^^ ~INK 31~ "YOU'RE NOT BY ANY CHANCE TOURISTS? CAVETOWN ONCE WAS A VERY ATTRACTIVE PLACE FOR TOURISM. THE CASTLE OF MANYEYES ATTRACTED MANY PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER LYRAMION. BUT FOR DECADES NOW, STRANGELY NOBODY COMES HERE ANYMORE. YOU ARE THE FIRST GROUP IN AGES. I HAVE LONG STOPPED BELIEVING IN A MIRACLE. I SUPPOSE YOU'VE SIMPLY BECOME SHIPWRECKED, OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE SEEN YOUR SHIP COMING."^^ ~INK 30~ SIGHING, THE MAN COLLAPSES INTO HIMSELF AGAIN.^^ ~INK 31~ "I'M TRISTAN, THE TOWN ADMINISTRATOR OF CAVETOWN. I ALSO RUN THE TOURISM OFFICE. THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO THERE ANYMORE. THAT'S WHY I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME HERE IN THE TAVERN. MY OFFICE IS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE CASTLE. IT'S CURRENTLY CLOSED. TOURISTS DON'T COME HERE ANYMORE. BUT MAYBE YOU COULD WATER THE FLOWERS IN MY OFFICE SOMETIME. HERE'S THE KEY."
