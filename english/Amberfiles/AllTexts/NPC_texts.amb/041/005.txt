"MY OFFICE IS IN MANYEYES' CASTLE ON THE EAST SIDE. I DON'T LIKE TO BE THERE. THERE IS NOTHING TO DO BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TOURISTS. IN ADDITION, IT GIVES ME THE CREEPS. PROBABLY THE ALCOHOL IS PLAYING A TRICK ON ME, BUT I COULD SWEAR I'VE HEARD STRANGE VOICES BEHIND THE WALLS. SINCE THEN, I ACTUALLY HARDLY EVER WENT TO THE OFFICE ANYMORE. MY FLOWERS PROBABLY ALREADY WITHERED. PERHAPS YOU COULD CHECK ON IT."
