"I GREET YOU, NOBLE ADVENTURERS. FINALLY SOME NEW FACES IN CAVETOWN. I AM JEFF, ONE OF THE GATEKEEPERS OF THIS TOWN. IN THE NORTHEAST THERE IS A PASSAGE THROUGH THE ROCKS THAT WE CAN CLEAR FOR SHIPS. FOR TOURISTS WE OPEN THIS GATE, BUT FOR PIRATES AND SCUM IT REMAINS CLOSED. BUT FOR DECADES NO SHIPS HAVE COME HERE. I BET THE STRENGTH OF THE WHIRLPOOL'S CURRENT HAS BECOME TOO STRONG. THEREFORE THE GATE HAS LITTLE MEANING AND I AM OUT OF WORK AS WELL. BOREDOM DRIVES ME INSANE, SO I TURNED TO ALCOHOL A LONG TIME AGO. SAY, DO YOU HAPPEN TO PASS BY THE TAVERN? MAYBE YOU COULD BRING ME A DELICACY FROM THERE. THE INNKEEPER MAKES AN EXCELLENT BLIND BRANDY. NOT FOR DELICATE NERVES, BUT I LOVE THAT STUFF."
