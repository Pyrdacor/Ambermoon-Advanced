"I REMEMBER SOMETHING NOW. A FEW MONTHS AGO, I WAS BY THE NORTHERN BEACH ABOVE CAVETOWN AT NIGHT AND WITNESSED SOMETHING STRANGE. I HAD MADE MYSELF COMFORTABLE WITH A BOTTLE OF ALCOHOL AND JUST WANTED TO HAVE SOME PEACE AND LISTEN TO THE WAVES. THEN THE WATER BEGAN TO BUBBLE AND A SMALL WHIRLPOOL FORMED. A VOICE SOUNDED IN MY HEAD AND TOLD ME TO STAY AWAY FROM ALCOHOL. I WAS QUITE SHOCKED AND RAN BACK TO THE CITY. MAYBE IT WAS JUST THE ALCOHOL, BUT IT SCARED ME AND SEEMED VERY REAL. I'M STILL NOT AWAY FROM THE GOOD DROPS, BUT I'LL DEFINITELY TRY. PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR SOMETHING AT NIGHT ON THE NORTHERN BEACH. I CAN'T TELL YOU ANYMORE ABOUT IT, SORRY."
