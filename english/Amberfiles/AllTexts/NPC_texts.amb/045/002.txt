"OUR MASTER THEODORUS WAS ACTUALLY A GOOD MAN. BUT DURING THE RENOVATION OF A CELLAR FOR A POWERFUL BLACK MAGICIAN, HE WAS BITTEN IN THE ARM BY A STRANGE MAGICAL SPIDER. HE WAS NEVER THE SAME AFTER THAT. STRANGELY, FROM THEN ON HE PREFERRED TO BUILD CELLARS AND STORAGE CAVES. HE PROBABLY LIKED THE DARKNESS ALL OF A SUDDEN."^^ ~INK 30~ SHUDDERING, GUSTAV GRABS HIS BEER MUG AND DRAINS IT.^^ ~INK 31~ "SOME TIME LATER, IT HAPPENED. WE WERE DIGGING OUT A CAVE WHEN SUDDENLY THE TORCH WENT OUT. STRANGE NOISES WERE HEARD AND SUDDENLY I HEARD A LOUD, EARTH-SHATTERING SCREAM FROM MY COLLEAGUE. I RAN BLINDLY AS FAST AS I COULD THROUGH THE DARK PASSAGES AND FORTUNATELY REACHED THE EXIT. I NEVER WANTED TO GO BACK INTO THAT CAVE AGAIN. MY COLLEAGUE DISAPPEARED AFTER THAT, BUT THEODORUS CAME TO WORK THE NEXT DAY WITHOUT A SCRATCH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED DOWN THERE, BUT I QUIT MY JOB RIGHT AWAY. I BELIEVE THAT THEODORUS WENT TO A NEW TOWN AFTER THE INCIDENT. PERHAPS HE WAS JUST AS TRAUMATIZED AS I WAS."^^ ~INK 30~ GUSTAV PAUSES FOR A MOMENT AND FORCES A SMILE.^^ ~INK 31~ "OUR MASTER WAS OTHERWISE AN EXEMPLARY CARPENTER AND BUILDER. HE IS THE ONLY LIVING LYRAMIONIAN WHO IS ABLE TO BUILD A WIND GATE. IF YOU MEET HIM, ASK HIM IF HE WILL BUILD ONE FOR YOU. JUST MENTION POSSIBLE BUILDING PROJECTS TO HIM."
