~INK 30~ THE OLD DWARF LOOKS AT YOU WITH A CLEAR EYE:^^ ~INK 31~ "I GREET YOU, YOUNG ADVENTURERS. AS I HEARD, YOU'VE RECENTLY ARRIVED HERE BY AIRSHIP. JUST LIKE US, YOU MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE SURPRISED WHEN YOU FIRST SET FOOT ON THIS MOON. MY NAME IS FELDRAR, AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A NATURE-LOVING FREE SPIRIT ON LYRAMION. MANY DWARVES HERE IN DOR GRESTIN ARE RELATIVELY YOUNG, BUT I BELONG TO THE OLD SCHOOL. WHENEVER I CAN, I EXPLORE THE WILDERNESS OF THIS MOON. ONLY AT NIGHT DO I STAY HERE IN DOR GRESTIN BEFORE I VENTURE BACK INTO THE DEEP JUNGLE AFTER MY MORNING BREW."
