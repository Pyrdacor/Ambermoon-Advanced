"THIS MOON IS DENSELY COVERED WITH RARE PLANTS, TALL TREES, POISONOUS FLOWERS, AND ALL KINDS OF INSECTS. EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING MAY SEEM VERY HOSTILE, ONE MUST REMEMBER THAT NATURE ON THIS MOON HAS NOT DEVELOPED WITH ANY CONSIDERATION FOR HUMANS, DWARVES, OR ELVES. IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT WE MUST FIRST FIND OUR PLACE HERE AND LEARN HOW TO COEXIST IN HARMONY WITH THE LOCAL CREATURES."
