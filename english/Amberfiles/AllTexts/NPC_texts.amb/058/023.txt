"IT'S NICE THAT YOU'VE COME. LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINT.^^ TWO OF MY BEST SCOUTS HAVE DISCOVERED A STRANGE CAVE IN A REMOTE CORNER OF THE MOON. WHAT'S PARTICULAR ABOUT IT IS THAT ONE CAN ONLY REACH IT BY FLYING. WE'VE TRIED DIGGING OUR WAY THERE, BUT WE QUICKLY ENCOUNTERED STRANGE MASSIVE WALLS UNDERGROUND. THESE SEEM TO BE VERY OLD.^^ RECENTLY, ONE OF OUR BEST ZOOLOGISTS HAS FOUND A WAY TO USE LOCAL CURSE-WASPS TO REACH HIGHER PLACES AND EVEN FLY TO ISLANDS. HIS NAME IS FELDRAR, AND YOU'LL FIND HIM AT THE LOCAL TAVERN. JUST ASK HIM ABOUT WASPS."
