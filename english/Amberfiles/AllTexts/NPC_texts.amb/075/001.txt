"I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU, AIRSHIP TRAVELERS. EVEN THOUGH MANY OTHER GNOMES CAN'T WAIT TO GET AWAY FROM HERE, I'VE ACTUALLY SETTLED IN QUITE WELL HERE AND WOULD PROBABLY EVEN STAY ON THIS MOON IF SOMEONE CAME TO PICK US UP. US YOUNGER DWARVES KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES AND TRY ALL KINDS OF NEW THINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, NEW TYPES OF BEER MADE FROM LOCAL PLANTS. THE INNKEEPER IS KIND ENOUGH TO LET ME EXPERIMENT FROM TIME TO TIME. HOWEVER, COLLECTING THE INGREDIENTS ISN'T WITHOUT DANGER, SO FOR NOW, I PREFER TO STAY HERE IN DOR GRESTIN."
