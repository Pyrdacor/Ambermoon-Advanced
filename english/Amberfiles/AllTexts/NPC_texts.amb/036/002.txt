"FOR A WHILE NOW THERE ARE BANDITS ALL OVER THE PLACE AT NIGHT. IT MAKES A CAT'S LIVE VERY DIFFICULT. I CAN BARELY CATCH ANY MOUSE DURING THE NIGHT. IF I WON'T GET ANY FOOD SOON, I'LL SURELY STARVE TO DEATH. BY ANY CHANCE, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT FOR A POOR LITTLE TOMCAT?"^^ ~INK 30~ WITH WIDE EYES HE LOOKS AT YOU, BEGGING FOR FOOD. HE EVEN REACHES OUT WITH HIS TINY PAW, ALMOST LIKE A HUMAN WOULD DO.
