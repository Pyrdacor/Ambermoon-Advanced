"LARGE PARTS OF LYRAMION CONSIST OF DESERTS. IT RARELY RAINS HERE AND THOSE ANIMALS THAT CAN WITHSTAND THE HEAT AND DRYNESS HAVE DEVELOPED ESPECIALLY. OUTSIDE THE CITY, LARGE DESERT LIZARDS LIVE IN PARTICULAR. I LIKE TO TEST MY WIND SPELLS ON THEM. YOU MUST KNOW THAT EACH SPELL UTILIZES A CERTAIN ELEMENT AND IS STRONGER OR WEAKER DEPENDING ON THE TARGET. DESERT LIZARDS LIVE IN SAND AND THEREFORE BELONG TO THE EARTH ELEMENT. EARTH SPELLS ARE THEREFORE INEFFECTIVE, BUT WIND SPELLS ARE ALL THE STRONGER. THE RIGHT SPELL, USED AGAINST THE RIGHT TARGET, CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. BUT BE CAREFUL IF YOU ENCOUNTER THE GOLDEN DESERT LIZARD. THEY ARE VERY RARE, BUT THEY ARE STRONGER AND HAVE THE FIRE ELEMENT. YOUR WIND SPELLS ARE WEAKER AGAINST THEM. HERE, HOWEVER, A WATER SPELL WOULD WORK WONDERS."
