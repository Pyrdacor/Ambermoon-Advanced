"I'VE ONLY SEEN A FEW GOLDEN ONES SO FAR. ALL OF THEM WERE LOCATED SOUTHWEST OF BURNVILLE. THEIR GOLDEN SCALES ARE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER BY US MAGES. WE USE THEM FOR ALL KINDS OF POTIONS AND ALSO FOR CLOTHING ITEMS. IF YOU BRING ME SEVEN OF THEM, I CAN FUSE THEM WITH A CHAINMAIL TO CREATE A STRONGER ARMOUR FOR YOU."
