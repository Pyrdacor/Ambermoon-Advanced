"OH, WHAT IS THIS? I HAVEN'T SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN A LONG TIME. AN ELEMENT CRYSTAL! HOWEVER, THIS ONE SEEMS TO HAVE LOST ALL OF ITS ENERGY. ALLOW ME TO CONDUCT A FEW EXPERIMENTS ON IT. I PROMISE YOU THAT IT WILL NOT BE DAMAGED. AFTERWARDS, I WILL RETURN IT TO YOU ENERGIZED."^^ ~INK 30~ WITH SHINING EYES, LEBAB TAKES THE INACTIVE CRYSTAL AND DISAPPEARS FROM THE ROOM. YOU DO NOT KNOW IF OR WHEN HE WILL RETURN. BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF WAITING, HE HAPPILY ENTERS THROUGH THE DOOR.^^ ~INK 31~ "TRULY REMARKABLE, THIS OBJECT. IT MUST BE VERY OLD. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME LOOK AT IT. I HAVE CHARGED IT UP FOR YOU AGAIN WITH ITS POWER."
