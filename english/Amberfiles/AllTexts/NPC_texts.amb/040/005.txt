"YOU ARE INTERESTED IN A CAT, ARE YOU? THAT'S WONDERFUL. PLEASE BE SO KIND AS TO GIVE ME 1000 GOLD PIECES FOR IT. I'M CERTAINLY NOT GREEDY, BUT THE GOLD MAKES SURE THAT NOT EVERY STRANGER TAKES A CAT WITH THEM AND THEN MAYBE DOESN'T TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT. IN ADDITION, I CAN BUY FOOD FOR THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH IT. MY WAGE AS A GARDENER IS RATHER MODEST. YOU ARE THUS DOING A GOOD DEED."
