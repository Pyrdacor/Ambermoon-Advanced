"WELL, I COULD TRUST YOU WITH A DOG. HOWEVER, YOU MUST SHOW ME HOW WELL YOU TREAT YOUR CAT FIRST. YOU MUST KNOW THAT ANIMALS UNDERSTAND YOU WELL. BUT THEY ONLY SPEAK TO THOSE THEY TRUST. IN MY SHOP, I SELL TOYS FOR THE LITTLE ONES. PERHAPS THAT WILL HELP TO GAIN TRUST. YOU CAN COME TO ME AGAIN WHEN YOUR CAT SPEAKS TO YOU."
