"HELLO DEAR NATURE LOVERS! ARE YOU, OR NOT? I AM FERDINAND, THE GARDENER HERE IN SPANNENBERG. FREIHERR GEORG HAS PERSONALLY ENTRUSTED ME WITH THE CARE OF THE CITY GARDEN AND I AM VERY PROUD OF IT. I LOVE NATURE WITH ALL ITS PLANTS AND ANIMALS. IN ADDITION TO MY ROLE AS A GARDENER, I TAKE CARE OF STRAY CATS AND DOGS HERE IN THE CITY. SAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADOPT A CAT OR A DOG? UNFORTUNATELY, I DO NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO CARE FOR THEM IN THE LONG TERM."
