JUST AS YOU ARE ABOUT TO STEP ONTO THE PLATFORM, YOU HEAR AN ANGRY, THREATENING HUM FROM THE NORTH. MUCH LOUDER THAN WHAT YOU'RE USED TO FROM THE WASPS. YOU LISTEN INTENTLY AS THE SOUND GROWS LOUDER. SMALL HOLES SUDDENLY FORM IN THE ANCIENT WALL BEFORE YOU, FROM WHICH CORROSIVE LIQUID BEGINS TO POUR. AND SUDDENLY, THE WALL COLLAPSES INTO CRUMBLING STONE AND REVEALS A MASSIVE WASP QUEEN, FURIOUSLY FLYING TOWARD YOU AND SPITTING A BEAM OF TOXIC LIQUID IN YOUR DIRECTION.
