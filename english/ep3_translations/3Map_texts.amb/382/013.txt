YOU GET CLOSER TO THE PORTAL WHEN SUDDENLY, CHAIN LIGHTNING UNLEASHES FROM THE TRIIS IN ALL DIRECTIONS. THE GROUP STRUGGLES TO EVADE THE ENERGETIC PROJECTILES.^^ WHILE A PORTAL BEGINS TO FORM WITHIN THE STONE ARCH, SHEERA IS STRUCK BY A LARGE LIGHTNING BOLT AND LIFTED INTO THE AIR. SEVERAL TRIIS BEGIN TO FLOAT IN THE FORCE FIELD, AS IF GUIDED BY AN UNSEEN HAND. IN PAIN, THE FELINIC EXPLORER WRITHES IN THE AIR AND CALLS OUT TO YOU WITH HER LAST STRENGTH: "NOW OR NEVER! CROSS THE PORTAL OR YOU WILL BE TRAPPED HERE FOREVER!"^^ THE GROUP LOOKS AROUND ANXIOUSLY, BUT IT IS CLEAR TO ALL THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO AGAINST THIS ALIEN FORCE. WITH A HEAVY HEART, YOU RUSH TO THE PORTAL AND ENTER THE DIMENSIONAL GATE.^^ AS YOU TRAVEL THROUGH THE TRANSITION, YOU CAST ONE LAST GLANCE BACK. ONE OF THE TRIIS MERGES WITH SHEERA'S HEAD, LEADING TO A STRANGE TRANSFORMATION. SHEERA BECOMES A HYBRID OF FELINE AND KRONDIR. JUST AS THE DIMENSIONAL FLOW TEARS AWAY, SHEERA OPENS HER EYES AGAIN. THE BIRTH OF A COMPLETELY NEW SPECIES IN THIS ALIEN WORLD. MAYBE SOMEDAY YOU WILL RETURN THERE.^^^DISCLAIMER: "IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THE 1996 GAME ALBION BY BLUE BYTE, YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD TRY IT.
