~LEAD~ PRESSES THE REINFORCED TRII AGAINST THE STRANGE CRYSTAL, AND BOTH BEGIN TO INTERACT. THE ORANGE COLOUR OF THE TRII SEEMS TO FLOW OUT OF THE CRYSTAL INTO THE WALL. YELLOWISH LIGHT SPREADS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE. AFTER A SHORT TIME, EVERYTHING GLOWS IN BRILLIANTLY BRIGHT LIGHT, AND WHEN YOU CAN SEE AGAIN, THE CRYSTAL HAS DISAPPEARED. THE TRII IN YOUR HAND, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO HAVE LOST ITS POWER ONCE AGAIN.
