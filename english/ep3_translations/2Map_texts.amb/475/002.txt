AFTER TOUCHING THE GLASS BALL, A SCENE FORMS ONCE AGAIN. YOU WATCH AS SOMEONE TREKS THROUGH SWAMPLAND. A VOICE REPORTS, BARELY AUDIBLE: "DIOKHAR FINALLY REMEMBERED THE ANCIENT GRAL SWAMPS. MANY BATTLES HAD TAKEN PLACE THERE OVER THE AGES, AND COUNTLESS WARRIORS AND MAGES HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE EVERLASTING MIRE. THE SWAMP CONTAINS ENORMOUS MAGICAL POWER, AND THE EAGER ALCHEMIST WANTED TO HARNESS IT FOR HIMSELF. SO, HE SET OUT ON HIS JOURNEY THERE."
