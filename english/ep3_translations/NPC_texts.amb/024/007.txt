~LEAD~ REPORTS TO BORE ABOUT THE JOURNEY TO THE FOREST MOON AND THE FATE OF THE DWARVES. HE LISTENS INTENTLY TO THE STORIES. FINALLY, HE SAYS:^^ "IF THERE ARE NO GEMSTONES UP THERE, IT'S BETTER FOR BORE TO STAY HERE."^^ YOU TELL HIM ABOUT THE ANCIENT FACILITY AND OTHER ADVENTURES, BUT BORE SEEMS CLEARLY DISINTERESTED. HOWEVER, WHEN ~LEAD~ MENTIONS THAT THE MACHINES ARE POWERED BY AMBER ROCKS, HE SUDDENLY TAKES NOTICE.^^ "OH, AMBER. THAT'S MY FAVORITE MATERIAL. IF ONLY I HAD A FEW NICE PIECES OF AMBER. THAT WOULD MAKE BORE HAPPY. IF YOU STILL HAVE SOME, I CAN OFFER YOU THESE STRANGE STONES IN EXCHANGE. I'LL GIVE YOU THE FIRST ONE FOR FREE. JUST TELL ME THE COLOUR AND WE'LL TRADE. BORE SECRETLY BROUGHT A FEW BOXES OF THESE STRANGE STONES BACK WHEN HE WORKED FOR A FEW STRANGE HOODED PEOPLE."
