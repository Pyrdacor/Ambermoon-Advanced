~INK 30~ HUDYN LOOKS VERY SAD AND TEARS RUN DOWN HIS CHEEKS.^^ ~INK 31~ "SINCE THE SEARCH HAS COME TO A SAD END, I JUST WANT TO BRING DOWN AS MANY OF THESE BEASTS AS I CAN. WE FOREST RUNNERS USUALLY WANT TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THE LOCAL FAUNA, BUT THIS IS PERSONAL NOW. WHILE EXPLORING THE CAVE, I CAME ACROSS THIS DOOR. IT'S DEFINITELY VERY OLD – FAR OLDER THAN THIS CAVE. THE WASPS MUST HAVE LATER BUILT AROUND THIS STRANGE STRUCTURE. THE DOOR DOESN'T SEEM TO OPEN, BUT I FOUND A KIND OF APPARATUS TO THE SOUTHEAST OF HERE. I'LL MEET YOU THERE."
