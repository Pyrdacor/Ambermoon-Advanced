"HELLO ADVENTURERS. MY NAME IS HUDYN, AND I AM A WOODSMAN FROM DOR GRESTIN. TOGETHER WITH MY COMPANION, I HAVE BEEN EXPLORING THIS CAVE, BUT IT'S SWARMING WITH AGGRESSIVE INSECTS. UNLIKE THE KNOWN WASP SPECIES, THESE LIVE UNDERGROUND AND HAVE ADAPTED TO THE SMELL OF THE MUSHROOMS. SO YOU CAN'T DRIVE THEM AWAY WITH THAT. APPARENTLY, THEY BUILD TUNNELS THROUGH THE WALLS, BUT THEN SEAL THEM OFF AGAIN. HOWEVER, IF THEY FEEL THREATENED, THEY SWARM OUT FROM THEIR SECRET CAVES. MY FRIEND HAD JUST TOUCHED ONE OF THEIR COCOONS WHEN A WHOLE SWARM SUDDENLY APPEARED BEHIND US. WE JUST MANAGED TO ESCAPE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAD TO SPLIT UP. I LOST SIGHT OF HIM AFTER THAT AND I'M VERY WORRIED."^^ ~INK 30~ WITH A CONCERNED EXPRESSION, HE ADDS:^^ ~INK 31~ "MAYBE WE'LL MEET AGAIN LATER. I CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE TIME WHILE MY FRIEND HAS TO STRUGGLE ON HIS OWN DOWN HERE."^^ ~INK 30~ WITH THESE WORDS, HUDYN QUICKLY DISAPPEARS AROUND A CORNER. ~INK 31~
