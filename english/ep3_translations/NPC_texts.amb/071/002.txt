"GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. AS I CAN SEE, YOU'VE BRAVED THE INSECTS AND MADE IT THIS FAR. NORTH OF HERE, THE PATH IS BLOCKED. THERE IS ONE OF THE DEADLIEST SUBSTANCES ON THE ENTIRE FOREST MOON, PROBABLY EVEN ACROSS ALL OF LYRAMION AND ITS MOONS. IT KILLS ANYONE WHO COMES INTO CONTACT WITH IT. TO GET PAST IT, YOU'D HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FLY. HOWEVER, I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE PLANTS IN THIS CAVE CAN GROW IN THE LIQUID AND EVEN NEUTRALISE IT. IF WE HAD ENOUGH OF IT, I COULD CREATE A CONCENTRATE AND REMOVE THE LIQUID. I WOULD GO LOOKING MYSELF, BUT I AM PRETTY WEAK. THE LAST SWARM OF INSECTS REALLY TOOK A TOLL ON ME. CAN YOU HELP ME AND MAYBE GATHER TEN OF THESE PLANTS? I HAVE SEEN A FEW NEAR THE CAVE EXIT."
