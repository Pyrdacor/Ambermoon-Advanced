"A FEW DAYS AGO, I CAME THROUGH A PORTAL FROM OUR WORLD TO HERE. I AM A PASSIONATE EXPLORER AND STUDY PORTALS LIKE THIS ONE. BUT AS IT SEEMS, MY LUCK HAS NOW RUN OUT, BECAUSE THIS CAVE APPARENTLY HAS NO EXIT AND A TERRIBLE BEAST LIVES HERE. I WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE IT SECRETLY, BUT IF IT FINDS US, WE'RE DONE FOR. I AM SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE. PERHAPS YOU CAN DEFEAT THE MONSTER AND CONTINUE EXPLORING THE CAVE. I WILL WAIT HERE FOR YOU AND LOOK FOR A WAY TO GET THE PORTAL WORKING AGAIN."
