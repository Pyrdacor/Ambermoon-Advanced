"WELCOME, FRIENDS. AH, KETNAR HAS ALREADY SPOKEN WITH YOU. IF YOU'RE STAYING WITH US A LITTLE LONGER, I HAVE ANOTHER TASK FOR YOU. BACK WHEN KIRE AND I PARTED WAYS IN AN ARGUMENT, I RAN THROUGH THE WILDERNESS TO A LAKE. OUT OF ANGER, I THREW MY WEDDING RING INTO THE WATER. NOW I REGRET IT AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT BACK. IF YOU WANT TO HELP ME, THE LAKE IS SOUTH OF MY OLD TREE. YOU CAN ALSO WALK WEST, THEN NORTHWEST FROM HERE, AND A LITTLE NORTH OF THE RUINS YOU'LL FIND THE LAKE."
