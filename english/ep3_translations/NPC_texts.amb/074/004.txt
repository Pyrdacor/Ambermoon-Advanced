"RECENTLY, I HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE WASPS MORE INTENSIVELY AND HAVE DISCOVERED SOME AMAZING THINGS. THEY ARE VERY SOCIAL CREATURES AND STICK CLOSELY TOGETHER."^^ ~INK 30~ FELDRAR RUBS HIS HANDS TOGETHER IN DELIGHT BEFORE CONTINUING.^^ ~INK 31~ "BUT WHAT IS EVEN MORE AMAZING IS THAT THEY ARE COMPLETELY DEAF AND ALSO HAVE POOR SMELLING ABILITIES. THEY LACK A HEARING ORGAN, AND THEIR NOSE IS POORLY DEVELOPED. INSTEAD OF A NOSE, THEY HAVE A STINGER FOR ATTACK, AND SMELLING IS RATHER SECONDARY. THIS IS WHY THEY ONLY REACT TO EXTREMELY STRONG SMELLS. INSTEAD OF EARS, THEY HAVE AN ADDITIONAL PAIR OF EYES. THEY CAN SEE VERY WELL, BUT THE OTHER SENSES ARE VERY POORLY DEVELOPED. WITH THE RIGHT CAMOUFLAGE, YOU CAN GET VERY CLOSE TO THEM. I HAVE OFTEN BEEN ABLE TO OVERPOWER THEM UNNOTICED. ONCE YOU’VE MANAGED THAT, YOU CAN TAME THEM ALMOST LIKE A HORSE AND EVEN RIDE THEM!"^^ ~INK 30~ A BRIGHT SMILE SPREADS ACROSS THE FACE OF THE OLD FELDRAR.^^ ~INK 31~ "TO HAVE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING SO FASCINATING AT MY AGE MAKES ME OVERJOYED. FLYING OVER THE TREE TOPS OF THE MOON RIDING A WASP WAS PROBABLY THE MOST BREATHTAKING EXPERIENCE OF MY LONG DWARVEN LIFE."^^ ~INK 30~ FELDRAR SLOWLY COLLECTS HIMSELF AGAIN.^^ ~INK 31~ "I'M SORRY. I GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY. YOU’RE PROBABLY WONDERING HOW TO RIDE A WASP, RIGHT? WELL, IT’S ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE. YOU NEED THE RIGHT WASP HARNESS, AND THEN YOU JUST HAVE TO SNEAK UP CLOSE TO A WASP AND QUICKLY PUT THE HARNESS ON. I WILL GIVE EACH OF YOU A HARNESS. JUST TRY IT OUT NEAR THE TOWN. THERE ARE WASPS ALMOST EVERYWHERE."
