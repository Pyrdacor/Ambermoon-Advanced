"FOR MY NEW BREW I NEED A PLANT THAT IS UNIQUE TO THIS FOREST MOON. AT LEAST AS FAR AS WE KNOW. EAST OF DOR GRESTIN THERE'S A RIVER, AND IN IT, THERE'S AN ISLAND. ON THIS ISLAND GROWS THE PLANT I NEED. WE CALL IT THE SAPPHIRE THISTLE, BECAUSE ITS BLOSSOMS LOOK LIKE SAPPHIRES AND IT HAS VERY PAINFUL THORNS. HOWEVER, IT'S VERY HARD TO DISCOVER, BECAUSE IT HIDES AMONGST OTHER BLUE PLANTS. YOU REALLY NEED DECENT SEARCHING SKILLS TO SPOT IT. AH, IF ONLY I HAD A HANDFUL OF THEM. FIVE PIECES WOULD BE ENOUGH. WELL, I GUESS THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE ABOUT IT."
