THESE ARE THE NOTES OF A MYSTIC NAMED ROWAN. ONE PAGE STANDS OUT PARTICULARLY.^^ "THE TRANSFORMATION SPELL IS THE MOST POWERFUL MAGIC ABILITY OF MYSTICS. IT ALLOWS ONE TO TEMPORARILY TAKE ON THE FORM OF ANOTHER BEING. IN DOING SO, ONE GAINS THE SAME PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ABILITIES AS THE TARGET. BUT BEWARE! IF THE BEING IS WEAKENED, SO TOO IS THE CASTING PERSON. IF ONE WANTS TO USE THE SPELL IN COMBAT, IT SHOULD BE CAST AT THE BEGINNING TO FULLY UTILISE THE POWER. YOU LOSE YOUR OWN ABILITIES, BUT YOUR OWN EQUIPMENT REMAINS WITH YOU."
