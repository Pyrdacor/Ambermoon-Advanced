"HELLO, MY NAME IS LUKE. I WORK AS THE DEPUTY GATEKEEPER HERE IN CAVETOWN. AS A SIDELINE I AM A PASSIONATE TREASURE HUNTER. ACCORING TO RUMOURS THERE IS A HUGE HOARD OF GOLD NOT FAR FROM THE TOWN. UNFORTUNATELY THE TREASURE MAP WAS ALSO BURRIED SOMEWHERE. BUT I AM SURE IT IS NOT FAR FROM HERE AS WELL. I FEEL IT."
