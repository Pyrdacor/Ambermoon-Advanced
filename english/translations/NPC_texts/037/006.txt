~INK 30~ WHEN YOU TELL KARL ABOUT MEETING HIS FORMER APPRENTICE, YOU NOTICE A SHORT SPARKLE IN HIS EYES.^^ ~INK 31~ "SO YOU FOUND GUSTAV. IT IS CORRECT THAT I CAN BUILD THE ANTIQUE WIND GATES. HOW ABOUT THIS? I'LL CREATE A WIND GATE FOR YOU AND OFFER YOU A SPECIAL PRICE. BUT IN RETURN I WANT TO USE THAT WIND GATE TO TRAVEL TO SNAKESIGN. I REALLY WANT TO SEE MY APPRENTICE AGAIN. HE DISAPPEARED SO SUDDENLY BACK THEN, THAT I COULDN'T EVEN SAY GOODBYE TO HIM. WHEN I COME BACK, I CAN ALSO DIG A STORAGE CAVE FOR YOU. SINCE A FEW YEARS THIS IS MY NEW SPECIALTY."
