"WELL, WELL! SO YOU HEARD ABOUT MY ADVENTURES AT SEA. THOSE ARE NOT LEGENDS AT ALL, THESE MONSTERS REALLY EXIST OUT THERE. TRUST ME, I SAW THEM WITH MY OWN EYES. I SAIL THE SEAS SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY AND OVER THE YEARS I WROTE EVERYTHING DOWN IN MY JOURNAL. I REALLY TREASURE IT BUT AS YOU SAVED MY LIFE, I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU."
