"I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TO TALK TO YOU. HOWEVER YOU SEEM TO BE NEW IN TOWN."^^ ~INK 30~ FOR A BRIEF MOMENT THE FACE OF THE MAN BRIGHTENS.^^ ~INK 31~ "YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY BY A TOURIST, RIGHT? MANY YEARS AGO, CAVETOWN WAS A GREAT PLACE FOR THE TOURISM. THE CASTLE OF MANYEYES ATTRACTED MANY PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER LYRAMION. BUT SINCE DECADES NOBODY COMES HIER ANYMORE. INDEED YOU ARE THE FIRST GROUP SINCE AGES. I HAVE GIVEN UP TO BELIEVE IN MIRACLES. I ASSUME YOU ARE JUST SHIP-WRECKED. OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE SEEN YOU COMING."^^ ~INK 30~ WITH A SIGH THE MAN SLUMPS DOWN AGAIN.^^ ~INK 31~ "MY NAME IS TRISTAN, I AM THE ADMINISTRATOR OF CAVETOWN. IN ADDITION I AM ALSO THE HEAD OF THE TOURIST OFFICE. BUT THERE ISN'T MUCH TO DO HERE LATELY. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IN THE TAVERN MOST OF THE DAY. MY OFFICE IS LOCATED AT THE EAST SIDE OF THE CASTLE. BUT IT IS CLOSED AT THE MOMENT. THERE ARE NO TOURISTS ANYWAY. BUT MAYBE YOU COULD WATER MY PLANTS FOR ME. HERE IS THE KEY."
