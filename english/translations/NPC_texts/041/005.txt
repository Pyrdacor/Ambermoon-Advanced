"MY OFFICE IS INSIDE MANYEYES' CASTLE ON THE EASTERN SIDE. I DON'T LIKE IT THERE AND THERE ISN'T ANYTHING TO DO THERE ANYWAY, BECAUSE NO TOURISTS ARE VISITING CAVETOWN ANYMORE. BESIDE THAT MY OFFICE GIVES ME THE CREEPS. I AM SURE IT IS ONLY THE ALCOHOL BUT I COULD SWEAR THAT I HEARD STRANGE VOICES BEHING THE WALLS. SINCE THEN I WASN'T THERE AT ALL. MY PLANTS ARE MOST LIKELY WITHERED ALREADY. PERHAPS YOU CAN CHECK IF EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER OVER THERE."
