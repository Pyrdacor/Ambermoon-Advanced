"OUR FOREMAN KARL WAS ACTUALLY A GOOD MAN. BUT DURING SOME WORKINGS IN THE CELLAR OF A BLACK MAGE, A STRANGE SPIDER BIT HIM IN HIS ARM. HE WASN'T THE SAME AFTERWARDS. BIZARRELY HE PREFERRED DIGGING STORAGE CAVES AND RENOVATING OLD CELLARS FROM THERE ON. I GUESS I LIKED THE DARKNESS SOMEHOW."^^ ~INK 30~ WITH A SHUDDER GUSTAV GRABS HIS BEER AND DRINKS IT EMPTY.^^ ~INK 31~ "THEN SOME TIME LATER IT HAPPENED. WE WERE JUST DIGGING A CAVE AS SUDDENLY THE FIRE OF THE TORCH WENT OUT. STRANGE SOUNDS WERE HEARD AND ALL OF A SUDDEN MY WORKMATE SCREAMED PAINFULLY. I RAN AS FAST AS I COULD THROUGH THE FARK CORRIDORS WITHOUT ANY SIGHT. LUCKILY I COULD REACH THE EXIT. I NEVER WANT TO GO BACK INTO THIS CAVE. MY WORKMATE HAS DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE BUT KARL CAME BACK TO WORK ON THE NEXT DAY WITHOUT A SCRATCH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT CAVE BUT I QUIT MY JOB ON THE VERY NEXT DAY. IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, KARL MOVED TO A DIFFERENT CITY AFTER THE INCIDENT. MAYBE HE WAS AS TRAUMATISED AS I WAS."^^ ~INK 30~ GUSTAV PAUSES FOR A MOMENT AND FORCES A SMILE.^^ ~INK 31~ "BUT BESIDE ALL THAT MASTER KARL WAS AN EXCELLENT ARCHITECT AND BUILDER. HE IS THE ONLY GUY ON LYRAMION WHO IS ABLE TO CONSTRUCT A WINDGATE. WHEN YOU MEET HIM, ASK HIM TO BUILD ONE FOR YOU. JUST CALL HIM ON POSSIBLE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS."
