"GREETINGS NOBLE ADVENTURERS. FINALLY SOME NEW FACES IN TOWN. I AM JEFF, ONE OF THE TWO GATEKEEPERS OF CAVETOWN. IN THE NORTHEAST OF THE CITY THERE IS A PASSAGE THROUGH THE ROCKS WHICH WE CAN OPEN FOR ARRIVING SHIPS. IN GENERAL WE OPEN IT FOR TOURISTS BUT KEEP IT SHUT FOR PIRATES AND OTHER RASCALS. BUT SINCE A FEW DECADES ALMOST NO SHIPS COME HERE ANYMORE AND IF SO ONLY BY ACCIDENT. I BET IT'S BECAUSE OF THE RIPTIDE CAUSED BY THE VORTEX. IT GOT TOO STRONG AT SOME POINT. SO THE GATEWAY HAS LOST ITS SIGNIFICANCE WHICH BASICALLY MADE ME REDUNDANT. THE BOREDOM REALLY KILLS ME. THAT'S WHY I TOOK TO THE BOTTLE. SAY, ARE YOU GOING TO THE TAVERN LATER BY ANY CHANCE? MAYBE YOU COULD BRING ME A DELICACY FROM THERE. THE INNKEEPER MAKES AN EXQUISITE BLINDING BOOZE. NOTHING FOR THE WEAK BUT I LOVE THIS STUFF."
