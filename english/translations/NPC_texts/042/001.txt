"HI, MY NAME IS ALEX THE HISTORIAN. I WAS THE FIRST TO BUILD A SHRINE TO THALION, PRESERVING THEIR LEGACY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS, NOTING THEIR SACRIFICES, HONOURING THEIR MEMORY. TIME IS MY GREATEST ENEMY. IN MY QUEST TO BUILD THE THALION SHRINE I HAVE BATTLED MANY ON EBAY AUCTION, BEEN FORCED TO LEARN ALIEN LANGUAGES SUCH AS HTML. TRAVELLED GREAT DISTANCES TO STRANGE EXOTIC PLACES MOST NOTABLY GUETERSLOH THE ANCESTRAL HOME OF THALION. COUNTLESS LETTERS HAVE I WRITTEN SEEKING OUT ALL OF "THE OLD ONES" ONLY FOR MOST TO BOUNCE "USER UNKNOWN". BUT SOME GOT THROUGH AND MANY THALIONITES I NOW CONSIDER AS FRIENDS. MAINTAINING THE SHRINE IS AN ENDLESS TASK, ALWAYS ONE MORE PAGE TO WRITE, ONE MORE JPG TO UPLOAD. SIGH. GOOD LUCK TO YOU ADVENTURERS!"
