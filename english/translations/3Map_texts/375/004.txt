THE INNKEEPER SAYS:^ "WELCOME TO THE SLEEPING EYS. IF YOU NEED SOME PLACE TO REST, JUST GO TO THE RECEPTION EAST OF THE SOUTHERN ENTRANCE. ARE YOU THIRSTY? THEN COME TO THE BAR ON THE LEFT. I SELL MY SPECIALTY THERE, THE BLINDING BOOZE. IT LIVES UP TO IT'S NAME. YOU WON'T GET BLIND BUT LOOKING STRAIGHT WON'T BE POSSIBLE ANYMORE. SO DRINK IT WITH CARE. IF YOU GET HUNGRY, COME TO THE BAR ON THE RIGHT."
