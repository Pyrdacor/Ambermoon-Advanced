AN ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNG MAN SMILES AT YOU:^ "HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE COUNTLESS TREASURES AROUND HERE? THE WHOLE CAVE AROUND CAVETOWN AND SHIP'S END IS BELIEVED TO BE FULL OF HIDDEN TREASURY. ALL YOU NEED TO YIELD THEM IS A SHOVEL. UNFORTUNATELY I HADN'T MUCH LOOK YET. NEXT TIME I WILL TRY TO DIG BENEATH SHELLS AND STARFISHS. MAYBE SOMEONE USED THEM AS A MARKER."
