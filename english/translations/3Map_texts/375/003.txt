A SLIM WOMAN LOOKS SCEPTICAL AT YOU:^ "I DON'T KNOW YOU. ARE YOU NEW IN TOWN? USUALLY WE OPEN OUR PASSAGE TO THE NORTH FOR NEWCOMERS. THE MECHANISM IS INSIDE THE GATEKEEPER HOUSE AT THE SOUTHEAST OF CAVETOWN. BUT THE DOORS CAN ONLY BE UNLOCKED BY THE TWO GATEKEEPERS WHICH LIVE IN THE HOUSES NEXT TO IT. SAY, DID YOU COME HERE WITHOUT A SHIP? THIS WOULD EXPLAIN WHY NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT YOUR ARRIVAL."
