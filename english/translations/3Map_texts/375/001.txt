THE OLD MAN LOOKS AT YOU HAPPILY:^ "FINALLY SOME NEW FACES HERE IN CAVETOWN. IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY YOU FIND THE LEGENDARY CASTLE OF MANYEYES. ONCE WE LIVED IN A SMALL VILLAGE CALLED SHIP'S END, BUT AFTER A GROUP OF HEROS DEFEATED THE MONSTER MANYEYES, WE DECIDED TO MOVE HERE. WE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR TOURISTS AND FOR A FEW YEARS THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM. BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY STOPPED COMING AT SOME DAY. OUR POOR TOWN ADMINISTRATOR TRISTAN IS DESPERATE AND TRIES TO DROWN HIS PROBLEMS IN ALCOHOL. YOU CAN FIND HIM JUST OVER THERE IN THE CORNER OF THE TAVERN."
