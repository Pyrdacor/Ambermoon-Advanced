A BLUFF PIRATE SCOWLS AT YOU: "I DON'T KNOW YOU AND CAN ONLY HOPE THAT YOU WON'T MEAN TROUBLE FOR ME. BACK IN THE DAYS I WAS A PIRATE ON A MIGHTY GALLEON AND TRAVELLED THE SEAS. BUT AT SOME POINT I FOUND MYSELF HERE. I STOPPED THE PLUNDERING AND INSTEAD BECAME A TREASURE HUNTER. ALL AROUND CAVETOWN THERE ARE PLENTY OF TREASURES SO WHY BOTHER ROBBING OTHER PEOPLE. IF YOU ALSO WANT TO TRY YOUR LUCK, VISIT THE MERCHANDISE TRADE AT THE NORTHEAST OF CAVETOWN. BESIDE SOME REALLY COOL ITEMS HE ALSO SELLS SHOVELS."
