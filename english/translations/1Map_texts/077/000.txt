YOU SAIL SOUTH OF THE MOANING DESERT RIGHT UP TO THE COORDINATES FROM TORLE'S JOURNAL. AN OVERSIZED GRIM-FACED SWORDFISH APPEARS SUDDENLY IN FRONT OF YOU. "I AM GLADO, ONE OF THE ~INK 23~FIVE SAGES OF THE SEA~INK 31~. I SENSE A DARK MENACE FOR MY HABITAT, THE SEAS OF LYRAMION. THE ~INK 23~OCEAN QUEEN~INK 31~ MIGHT HELP US BUT SHE ONLY INVITES THOSE WHO HAVE ALL THE SAGES' BLESSINGS. I DON'T KNOW YOU, BUT I ADVISE YOU TO HELP US. OTHERWISE I'LL PIERCE A HOLE THROUGH YOUR SHIP SO THAT YOU END UP ON THE OCEAN FLOOR. NOW GO AND FIND THE OTHER SAGES."
