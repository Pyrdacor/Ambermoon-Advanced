TORLE SEEMS TO HAVE PAINSTAKINGLY WRITTEN DOWN EVERY DETAIL OF HIS JOURNEYS. IT TAKES A WHILE UNTIL YOU FIND SOMETHING INTERESTING.^^^FIRST DAY OF THE SEVENTH MOON 961^^"TODAY THE SKY WAS BLUE AND THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY, BUT IN THE EVENING SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED. NOT FAR FROM THE HARBOUR, THE WATER BENEATH US FIRST STARTED TO BUBBLE IN AN UNUSUAL WAY. SPUMING WAVES THEN APPEARED EVERYWHERE AROUND US AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE WHOLE SHIP WAS LIFTED UP INTO THE AIR AND WE FOUND OURSELVES ON THE BACK OF A GIANT ~INK 17~TURTLE~INK 31~. AFTER A FEW MINUTES IT DOVE BACK INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN AND WE COULD SAIL ON AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. IT WAS A HUGE SHOCK FOR ME AND MY CREW THOUGH. WE WERE NORTH EAST OF SPANNENBERG AT ~INK 17~550, 402~INK 31~."^^A FEW PAGES LATER YOU FIND THE FOLLOWING ENTRY.^^^NINTH DAY OF THE EIGHTS MOON 961^^"FINALLY WE ARE AT SEA AGAIN. I COULD BARELY STAND THE BORING ROUTINE AT LAND. THE WEATHER TODAY WAS STORMY AND WE HAD OUR TROUBLES TO AVOID CRUSHING INTO THE EASTERN ROCKY COAST OF HOIMON. AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, A HUGE ~INK 17~WATER SNAKE~INK 31~ POPPED UP OUT OF THE OCEAN AROUND ~INK 17~773, 313~INK 31~. IT LEFT US ALONE EVENTUALLY, BUT IT WAS STILL A HUGE SHOCK FOR US."^^^DAY SEVENTEEN OF THE EIGHTH MOON 961^^"AS IF THE WATER SNAKE WASN'T ENOUGH FOR ONE JOURNEY, WE ALSO ENCOUNTERED ANOTHER MONSTER TODAY. SOUTH OF THE MOANING DESERT APPROXIMATELY AT ~INK 17~621, 205~INK 31~ AN ENORMOUS ~INK 17~SWORDFISH~INK 31~ JUMPED OVER OUR ENTIRE SHIP."^^THE NEXT PAGES DO NOT CONTAIN ANY INTERESTING EVENTS BUT THEN YOU FIND SOMETHING.^^^PENULTIMATE DAY OF THE THIRD MOON 964^^"TODAY WE TRAVELLED SOUTHWARDS AND PASSED THE BLACK MOUNTAINS. ASTONISHING AND AT THE SAME TIME TERRIFYING. BUT MUCH MORE FRIGHTENING WAS THE ENORMOUS ~INK 17~PIRANHA~INK 31~ WHICH STARTED GNAWING ON THE SHIP. WE HAD TO SAIL ON VERY FAST TO ESCAPE IT. I GUESS IT WAS AT ~INK 17~311, 446~INK 31~."^^^DAY TWENTY OF THE THIRD MOON 964^^"YET AGAIN WE ENCOUNTERED TWO MONSTERS ON ONE JOURNEY. AS WE SAILED FURTHER TO THE SOUTH AND WERE SAILING ROUND THE BIG FOREST ISLAND TO THE WESTERN SEA, WE SAW A HUGE WATER FOUNTAIN. IT WAS PRODUCED BY THE BLOWHOLE OF THE BIGGEST ~INK 17~WHALE~INK 31~ I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE WATER FLOODED THE DECK AND TOOK SOME OF MY MEN WITH IT. I COULD HOLD MYSELF ON THE STEERING WHEEL WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT MANY GOOD MEN LOST THEIR LIFE ON THIS DAY. IT HAPPENED AT ~INK 17~173, 773~INK 31~."^^NEARLY AT THE END OF THE JOURNAL YOU SPOT ANOTHER INTERESTING ENTRY.^^^FIRST DAY OF THE NINTH MOON 967^^^"TODAY WAS A NICE DAY AT SEA. WE SAILED ON THE WESTERN SEA WHEN SUDDENLY A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN APPEARED NEXT TO THE SHIP. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN! TO OUR SUPRISE SHE HAD NO FEET BUT INSTEAD A FISHY TAIL WITH SCALES. SHE HAD RED HAIR LIKE FIRE. WHEN WE TRIED TO RESCUE HER, SHE SUDDENLY DESCENDED INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A ~INK 17~MERMAID~INK 31~. I NEVER SAW SUCH BEAUTY. I'LL DEFINITELY SEARCH FOR HER. AT ~INK 17~126, 530~INK 31~."
