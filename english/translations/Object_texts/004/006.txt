I AM THE LAST REMAINING RESIDENT OF SHIP'S END. BUT NOW I WILL ALSO LEAVE THIS PLACE AND HEAD FOR CAVETOWN, SOUTHWEST FROM HERE. SURVIVING ALONE IS TOO HARD FOR ME, BUT I WILL STILL MISS THIS VILLAGE VERY MUCH. NATURE IS ALREADY RECLAIMING THESE WOODEN HOUSINGS AND I HOPE NOTHING WILL COME FOR ME DOWN HERE IN THIS DARK CELLAR BECAUSE NOBODY WILL BE THERE TO HELP ME. TOMORROW MORNING I WILL SET OUT FOR CAVETOWN. IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD TO SWIM THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PASSAGE WITH MY SOBEK'S RING.
