WHEN YOU TAKE OUT THE STICK, YOU IMMEDIATELY HAVE THE FULL ATTENTION OF THE LITTLE DOG. IT APPROACHES YOU AND WAGS HIS TAIL. YOU HAVE A FEELING THAT YOU SHOULD THROW THE STICK THROUGH THE ROOM. AS YOU DO SO, THE DOG STARTS RUNNING AFTER IT AND THEN COMES BACK WITH THE STICK IN HIS MOUTH. WITH ANTICIPATION IT DROPS IT IN FRONT OF YOUR FEET. YOU THROW IT A FEW MORE TIMES AND AFTERWARDS THE LITTLE DOGGY SNUGGLES YOUR LEG. "MANY THANKS FOR PLAYING WITH ME. YOU CAN NOW ALWAYS TALK TO ME."
