THIS CAVE WAS DUG BY KARL. IT LOOKS PRETTY TINY AND ONLY CONSISTS OF ONE LITTLE CORRIDOR. MAYBE HE LOST MOTIVATION? IN ANY CASE IN THIS STATE IT WON'T BE USABLE AS A STORAGE ROOM OR THE LIKE.^^DISAPPOINTED YOU JUST WANT TO LEAVE AS YOU DISCOVER A BIG WHOLE AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR. HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE ENOUGH ROPES IN YOUR BAGS TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK TO THE SURFACE.
