This section is about general changes to the game.


## Food weight

Each ration has a weight of 25 instead of 250 now. So it is possible to carry much more of it.


## Weapon damage adjustments

**NOTE**: This is currently only implemented for the Amiga version and is still missing from the remake.

In the original, you get a damage bonus of Strength / 25 (rounded down) to your attack damage.
So the attack damage is the damage from all equipped items combined plus your strength divided by 25.

In the expansion this is only the case for close ranged weapons and they get an additional bonus of
Dexterity / 50.

Long ranged weapon on the other hand get a bonus of Dexterity / 25 and Strength / 50 instead.

So it might be beneficial to increase dexterity for characters which use such weapons like rangers.


## Item changes

No new items are mentioned here explicitely. There are a lot. Mostly quest items, new equipment and
some new spell scrolls.

Only changed items are listed here.

- Water of life now grants "Wake the dead" instead of "Resurrection". So only reviving 1 person instead of the whole group.
  However through a quest later you can produce golden water from water of life which again grants "Resurrection" but needs
  two more ingredients: a golden scale and a fire thistle. It was a bit overpowered to have almost unlimited access to
  "Resurrection" in the early game which made the spell itself almost useless to learn.
- Sling daggers and knives no longer grant damage bonus to weapons other than the dagger sling. However there are new
  off-hand daggers which can be used by thieves and rangers (only available on forest moon).
- The shovel was not changed but it finally has some usage. In the original there was not a single usage opportunity.
  Now there are a lot of places where you can find treasures with it or it is even required for some quests. Usually the
  game hints when it is time to dig something up. So don't waste your time to try digging all over Lyramion.
- Shadow belt now has 15 instead of 5 charges of "Blink".
- Murder blade has its damage and magic weapon level increased a bit.
- Many other early and mid game weapons have the magic weapon level increased a bit to be more usable.
- Arrows and magic arrows have their weight decreased drastically (150 to 25 and 125 to 20 respectively).
- Sling stones and bolts have also greatly decreased weight values.
- Dorina's brooch now holds 15 charges of "Alchemistic Globe". Before the item was a bit weak without any spell.


## Elements

The element of damage dealing spells now depends on the target's element. Monsters with the same element as the spell
are completely immune to the spell. For example fire dragons are immune to fire spells and stone golems are immune to
earth spells.

The mystic has a new spell to reveal the monster's element. The spell "Monster knowledge" will now also display the
element of the monster.

You can find the item "Elemental table" which gives information about elemental damage bonuses and maluses. For example
water spells deal increased damage to fire monsters, while wind spells do less damage to fire monsters.

The mystic can acquire new spells to change the element of a target monster.


## Search skill

The search skill is now used in many places. Some chests are hidden and you can only find them with a high search skill.
Some quest rely on it as well, especially when the NPC says that it is not easy to find. Often you get a hint in form of
a text popup when your search skill is too low.


## New spells

The alchemist can learn a new spell called "Ghost Inferno" which works exactly like "Ghost Weapon" but fires it at
every single enemy, making it a great damage dealing ability. The spell can only be obtained from a quest.

The mystic can learn a lot now spells:

- "Show Elements": For the rest of the battle you can see the monsters' elements as a tooltip.
- "Recognize Weak Point" / "See Weaknesses" / "Knowledge Of The Weakness": Weakens the targets for the rest of the battle to receive 30% (bosses 15%) increased damage from attacks and spells.
- "Foresee Magic": For the current battle round, all enemies will have their chance to cast spells successfully reduced by 25%.
- "Foresee Attack": For the current battle round, all enemies will have their chance to hit with an attack reduced by 25%.
- "Mystic Decay": Deals mental element damage to an enemy, which is increased based on the caster's level and the target's missing health. Max damage without other bonuses would be at caster level 50 and target hit points below 10% at 150 damage. The spell will deal at least 5 damage.
- "Protection Sphere": For the current battle round, the caster will block all incoming spells.
- "Element To Earth/Wind/Fire/Water": Changes the element of the target monster to earth, wind, fire or water.
- "Mystic Imitation": The mystic transforms himself into the target monster and gains its:
  - Attacks per round
  - Element
  - Hit points
  - Spell points
  - Magic weapon level
  - Magic armour level
  - Attack, parry, critical strike and use magic skill levels
  - Learned spells
  - Attack damage
  - Defense
  Moreover you can no longer access the mystic's inventory for the battle's duration. After the fight, the mystic will transform back. This spell is only obtainable through a quest and only Targor can get it naturally.


  ## Spell learning points

  A lot of spells have different spell learning point requirements now. Stronger or more useful spells have in general a higher SLP value while weaker spells have lower values.

  The sages (e.g. in Spannenberg) can tell you the required SLP for a spell scroll (new button).

  In general master classes like alchemist, mystic and healer have much more SLP now in contrast to the hybrid classes like adventurer, ranger and paladin.


  ## New mount

  Through a quest you can unlock a new mount on the forest moon. But only in a later stage of the progression there. This allows for faster and secure travel there.


  ## New map markers

  - The gnome mine has now map markers for buildings, so you can return to them easier.
  - The 2 new places in Spannenberg also have markers.
  - The new place in Dor Grestin as well.
  - The new city Cavetown also has several map markers.
