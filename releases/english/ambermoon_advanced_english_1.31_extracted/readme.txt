Ambermoon Advanced English 1.31 by Pyrdacor (28-02-2025)
========================================================

Ambermoon Advanced is an extension of Ambermoon.

It adds content like new places, quests, monsters, NPCs and items.
Moreover it changes a few aspects of the game to balance it, add a
bit more challenge or make some aspects or characters more valuable.

Version 1.3x contains the first 3 episodes:

- Mysteries of the see
- Elemental creatures
- The green jewel

The state of bugfixes is mostly based on original version 1.18 english.
