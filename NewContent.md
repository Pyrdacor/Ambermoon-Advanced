## Details

### Secret room

In the secret room in your house there is a new bookshelf. When you examine it you get some basic
information about the new things in Ambermoon Advanced. Including new element system etc.

### Theodorus Quest

In the lower left area of Spannenberg you can find Theodorus the carpenter. He can build several things
for you after you gave him the last will of your grandfather.

For 2500 gold he renovates your house. This is a requirement to get pets from Ferdinand (see below).

Later in Snakesign you can find Gustav in the tavern. He was Theorodus' apprentice. After talking to
him and returning to Theodorus, he offers you to build a wind gate and after that a storage cave.

The storage cave is a new mini dungeon east of your house. At the end of it waits a fight and a reward.

### Ferdinand and Kasimir

At the back of the Spannenberg tavern there is a new building accessible through the town park. Here
lives Ferdinand the local gardener which can give you a cat and a dog as a pet. But first you have
to gain his trust by helping an animal in need.

First you will need the animal language. You can get it from Sandra by guessing her old tomcat's
name. If you don't know it from Amberstar, ask Ferdinand about "tomcat".

Northeast of Spannenberg inside the second town house where the couple lives, there is a new tomcat NPC
which is hungry. Either giving him 1 ration or 1 pet food (obtainable from Ferdinand's shop) will make
him happy. This act of kindness will gain Ferdinand's trust. Moreover the tomcat Kasimir is now willing
to join your party.

Kasimir is the first animal party member. Animals are different from other party members.

- They can not level up naturally (and won't consume EXP, so the others get more).
- They can only use and carry items which are usable by animals.
- They have a special item called "Cat lives". It is basically a self-revive spell which works 7 times.
- They are only useful in very early game but can be empowered later (see other quest lines) and get very strong.

Ferdinand will now give you a cat. But only if you have renovated your house (see Theodorus quest).
It costs 1000 gold as well.

Before you can obtain the dog, you have to gain the trust of your new cat. To do so, buy the cat toy from
Ferdinand's shop and use it next to your cat which waits in your house. From now on you can talk to your
cat like with any other NPC. As your cat asks for food, you can give her some, which grants EXP, but only
for the first time. The cat will still eat all your pet food or rations.

Now Ferdinand will give you the dog as well. You can buy a dog toy and use it with your dog. After that
Ferdinand will give you a small reward when you visit him again. You can also talk to your dog now.
If you have any stick from your adventures, you can play with him again. The stick is not consumed and
you get some EXP on first play.

### Magic school of Burnville

In the magic school of Burnville you can find the elemental damage table in a bookshelf. It lists the
damage bonuses when you use elemental spells on monsters.

You can also find a new NPC called Morgat here, but only after your freed the people from Luminor's tower.

He tells you something about elemental spells and golden lizard. If you bring him 7 golden scales and a
chain mail, he will give you a golder armour. The golden lizards can be founds southwest of Burnville above
the mountain range.

### Creatures of the sea quest line

In Burnville in the house of arts you can talk to Michael. After obtaining the map from him you can ask
him about the map and he will tell you about the creatures of the sea. You should then go to Spannenberg
and talk to Captain Torle about it. He will give you his journal. In it you find several coordinates.
When you reach those by boat you will trigger events with certain creatures. You have to visit the first
five creatures first (in any order) but at last the mermaid.

You will enter the mermaid's cave and talk to her. After that the big vortex in the northwest of the world
map will become accessible. Here it is good to have a high swim skill or rings of sobek to proceed.

At the east side of the vortex cave, you will find the small village of Ship's End (Amberstar reference).
It is mostly abandonded but you can find a diary and another ring of sobek. From there to the southwest
you finally reach Cavetown, a new city which was built around Manyeyes' castle.

Here you can start several quests. First you might want to visit the local tavern and talk to Tristan,
who runs the tourist office. He will give you his key to check for the plants. The office is part of
Manyeyes' castle. Its entrance is one the eastern side.

In the first room you here strange voices. One wall can be removed by touching it. It is slightly
different in visuals. 2 undead encounters and another disappearing wall later you are in the big
hallway. You can also obtain the dark blade, but I would not suggest to equip it.

Proceed into a corridore where you have to touch a wall again. After several fights you make your way
up to the roof of the castle (or what is left of it). Obtaining the ancient key you can open the only
remaining door up there. After a boss fight you get two very strong items for the adventurer.

Next you will find yourself in the basement and encounter the remains of Manyeyes. You can reach a
wall with an eye in it. After killing all enemies you can proceed. Leaving the castle through the
large main doors will unlock a secret room in the castle with rewards.

In Cavetown you can also unlock a shortcut to the cave exit. You have to get the keys from the two
gate keepers living in the southern houses. You get the key from Jeff by bringing him a blind brandy
you can buy from the tavern. For Luke's key you have to find a map which is burried east of cavetown
near the palisade wall under a shell.

With both keys you can enter the lower left building in Cavetown and find a pressure plate there to
open the passway. The whole cave also contains some spots where you can dig with a shovel.

### Elemental creatures quest line

In the Newlake library in the final room you find a new book called "Towns of Lyramion". It hints to
a sign west of the Sighing Desert in the north eastern part of Lyramion. You can find the sign and
some conspicuous spot nearby. You can dig a hole there and enter the Crystal wine cellar. After some
monsters and levers you can reach the old paladin guild. You can also obtain Sandra's brooch in a
secret room. When you bring it back to Sandra in Spannenberg you can empower Kasimir if he is in your
party by bringing her essences of powerful creatures (see the following sections).

In the paladin guild you need Gryban to proceed. First gather all Paladin emblems and put them into
the central vessel to spawn the undead paladin boss. You will unlock more areas of the guild. There
you can find a library and an altar to exchange experience. Using a stone of knowledge at the altar
will give you a transformation stone. Using it on some other party member will exchange the experience
between the user and the target. Animals and dead people are not possible as targets. This is useful
if you want to pick up another party member in late game. You can give the experience of another
party member to the new one. Note that the experience is exchanged, not the level! Based on the
characters' classes the levels will need different amounts of experience. Use the stones wisely.
They are consumed and are very limited.

You can also find the statue of Gunbar the noble paladin. If you found the books about strong
creatures in the library the statue will drop an essence. You can also find the essence of
Fargon in a chest. These essences can be used by Sandra to empower Kasimir. In total there
are six such essences on Lyramion. You can later find another one on the forest moon.

Now you have four more options for obtaining the other essences. You can do them in any order.

#### Marla's essence

If you leave the paladin guild and head right to the east you will enter the large sighing
desert. If you explore the area you will trigger an event at some point were the desert
sands swallow you. You find yourself in an underground desert temple. Here you can find spots
with soft sand patches where you can dig yourself to a lower level. There are several levers
in the dungeon which control certain wall movements. The crystal balls state that you should
close the eyes and open the mouth. So change the walls so that the face on the dungeon map
has closed eyes and an open mouth. Then a new teleporter appears which leads further into the
dungeon. Down there you will find three riddlemouths. They ask for combinations of Marla,
the mother of earth, with three other elemental creatures. Mainly these are the combinations
of earth and wind, which is sand, earth and fire, which is lava or magma and finally earth
and water, which is swamp. At the end you will find and defeat Marla to obtain her essence.
There is also the earth altar. A black mage can touch it and empower his earth spell damage.
It will match the damage of the associated ice spells.

#### Lugthir's essence

After defeating Sansri and bringing her blood to Pelanis in Illien, he will give you the
key to the eyrie if you show him the book about mystic creatures. Heading northwest of
Illien you reach a mountain range with a door to the eyrie. Inside you find the wind
altar to empower wind spells of black mages and the essence of Lugthir.

#### Pyrdacor's essence

Talking to Baron Karsten about Pyrdacor in Newlake and showing him the mystic creatures
book, will grant you an inactive crystal. Lebab in his tower can activate the crystal.
Located west of Newlake are the black mountains. At the southern side you can use the
activated fire crystal to open a passway into the mountain. First take the upper left
door and explore the area. You can obtain the flame key here. Looking at the dungeon map
you see numbers and a calculation. Remember the result and head back up to the entrance room.
Next go to the far east where you find two doors. First enter the lower one with the
flame key and defeat Pyrdacor. Take the magic parchment and now take the upper door.
You have to enter the result of the calculation and finally arrive in a new 3D area with
some pillars in the distance. The room is full of hidden spinners and only the right
path will bring you forward. Read the parchment carefully. Place yourself east of the
western pillar directly in the nothern area of the room. Follow the directions in reverse
order. Each direction must be a full tile. You can spin how often you want, but never
leave the intended tile path. At the end you find the fire key. Back in the entrance room
take the right one of the two nothern doors and open it with the fire key. You encounter
Pyrdacor a second time and he drops the lava key. You also find a well here. Droping
wishing coins into it will grant some experience points. Now head back up and take the
door to the left which is unlocked with the lava key. You stand in front of a lava
stream. Don't jump in there. Head back up and Pyrdacor will speak to you and teleport
you to a new area. Answer "Pyrdacor" to the riddlemouth to proceed. You will find a lot
of teleporters here. Best track the destinations on a piece of paper. The teleporters
do not work randomly. All destinations are fixed per teleporter so you can find the way
through trial and error and writing them down. At the end you can just leave but Pyrdacor
will laugh at you and you have to do it again. So before leaving you should search for a
hidden chest behind a fake wall. In it you find a magic raft. With it you can finally
pass the lava stream. Enter the cave and meet Pyrdacor for the third and last time.
You get his essence from him and a mighty fire staff. In the room you can also find the
fire altar to empower fire spells for black mages. Going back will create another passage
through the nothers lava stream. You can find the flamberge and the magma key in a chest.
With the magma key you can unlock the last door in the entrance room to quickly leave
the dungeon.

#### Isdir's essence

Back in the vortex cave (see Creatures of the sea quest line) you can ask people in
Cavetown for Isdir. Eventually Jeff, one of the gate keepers, will tell you about
a strange happening at the northern beach just outside of Cavetown at night. So head
there at night and move over the beach. Isdir will talk to you and a small vortex
will appear. Swimming into it will bring you to Isdir's cave. You find four magic
crystals here. After touching them, they give you cryptic hints. You can do the quests
in any order.

1. Get a water of life (fountain of life northeast of Spannenberg), a fire thistle
   (near the witch's hut) and a golden scale (from a golden lizard southwest of Burnville)
   and bring them to Lebab in his tower. He will create a golden water for you.
   Bring it to the magic crystal in the northeast corner in Isdir's cave.
2. West of Newlake there is an island with the plain of Thal. You can find a group of
   five trees there surrounding a small patch of water. Looking at it will summon Isdir
   and he tells you to look for a fallen tree nearby. Head west and a bit south to reach
   a mountain range and a fallen tree. You have to approach it at night. After defeating
   the beast, go a bit north until you find something resembling a garden. Try to dig
   where the yellow flower grows and you will obtain a blue crystal. Bring it to the
   southeast magic crystal in Isdir's cave.
3. Go to the southern end of Sansri's island. There is a small beach beyong the mountains
   where you can dig up a snake from a shell with your shovel. Bring it to the southwest
   magic crystal in Isdir's cave.
4. Head to the graveyard in Spannenberg and go to the last corner where the necromancer
   usually spawns. Make sure you go there at night and touch the gray tombstone. A restless
   ghost will appear and attack you. Obtain its soul and bring it to the northwest magic
   crystal in Isdir's cave.

After all four tasks are completed, Isdir will give you his essence when you talk to him.
He will also disappear and make room to reveal two more chests with valuable items.

#### Empowering Kasimir

After you gave her brooch back to Sandra, she will take each essence you give her and
empower Kasimir. He has to be alive and in the party of course. Kasimir will get levels
and additional stats based on the essence. He will also change his appearance after the
first and sixth essence. When all six transformations were performed by Sandra, she
gives you her brooch back but empowers it beforehand so it is a very strong brooch in
the game. This marks the end of this quest line.

Kasimir will reach level 45, has 22 base attack damage and defense, 362 hit points,
30 strength and stamina, 160 speed, 95 luck and 15 anti magic (to emphasize the
battle related attributes). Especially the 160 speed allows him to perform 3 tile
movements in battle and increases his attacks per round up to 5.

He can also perfectly swim now, has 85% attack (hit chance) and 25% parry chance.
His max critical strike chance is then 5% and he can learn the skill at a trainer.

### The Gral temple

Leonaria carries a diary with her, writing about a temple in the Gral swamps.
She wants to look for someone in Snakesign who knows about the temple. You
can find Melvin in the western part of the village of Snakesign and he will
tell you about the temple. Go northwest of Sansri's island to the Gral swamps
and look for a spot near the mountains with yellow plants. Make sure you be
there at night and say the word "Gral" (mouth cursor on the mountains). A
new entrance should appear. The temple tells the story about Diokhar, an
unlucky alchemist from the past who tried to make use of the ancient undead
souls the swamp swallowed over the centuries. At the end you will face his
undead spirit and gain the spell "Ghost Inferno" as well as a magic staff
which also holds this spell. You will also get access to the old sewers
where you can find the remains of Melvin (Amberstar reference). If you
bring the emerald chain back to Melvin in Snakesign you complete the quest.

### Mystic tower

Targor has some notes in his backpack. Following the instructions you
should head to Illien and then go west from there until you reach a
small pond. Targor will touch the water and obtain a water symbol.
Next fly southeast until you reach a large tree on the neighboring
island. Targor will obtain a second symbol. Go south on the same isle
and go through the mountain pass there. After Targor receives the
third symbol, a tower will emerge from the grounds. Head northwest
to enter the mystic tower. Here the ultimate test waits for Targor.
He can obtain the new spell "Mystic imitation" and unlock the library
afterwards with more new mystic spells.

### Gnome mine

Back in the gnome mine you can visit the search trainer. He has a
quest for you to search hidden things in the mine. You will need
a high search skill and even some help from the mystic spells which
can boost your search skill even further ("Knowledge", "Clairvoyanc"
and "See the truth"). After finding all hidden things you get a
reward.

### Dorina's quest

After reuniting Kire and Dorina, she will give you the quest to
look for her wedding ring. If you find it, you get the alchemist
crown. It will cripple your hit chance with weapons but grants
25 bonus attack damage which will increase the damage of your
ghost spells by a lot.

### Antique Area level 3

In the original this map was a bit confusing as you had to wait
until some ceiling lamp turned on. Most players only progressed
by pure luck (when running into a teleport many times and the
time was right by accident). There was also a huge area with some
levers and monsters which was totally useless and could be skipped
entirely. Now the map is completely different beside the small
entrance room. You will find two large rooms where you have to
solve a riddle (also related to ceiling lamps).

In the central room you have to enter the teleporters when the lamp
is on (in reference to the original map), but you see the lights
going on and off more clearly and the room works like some kind of
a clock. If you entered each teleporter at the right time and pulled
all the levers, this room is completed.

The western room has three levers at the southern wall. Each unique
combination of on/off states will provide a different destination
for the central teleporter. This way you can reach eight different
levers which toggle the lights in the room. The right combination
is key to complete the room. The light pattern should match the
one from the other room you completed earlier, so four lamps on
and the rest off.

After completing both rooms you can proceed and finally reach
level 4. When you come back up to level 3 with a nav stone,
a new shortcut will arise which brings you directly to Dor Kiredon.
This way you can also quickly access the deeper levels of the
antique area.

### The nest

The tavern in Dor Grestin can now be visited. You can find Brogat
there who brews potions from local plants. He asks you to bring
him five saphire thistles which can be found east of the town on
an island inside the river. You will need a high search skill to
find them and they only spawn randomly as you move over the island.
Each potion will grant all-healing and you also get a bit of gold.

You can also find Feldrar but only for a very short time in the
morning from around 6:30 to 9:00. After you got the wasp quest
from Ketnar, you can ask him about "Wasps" and he will give you
the wasp riding tack. When using it outside the towns you can
ride a wasp.

### Wasp quest

When you enter the air ship with a blue or yellow nav stone,
Ketnar will appear and ask you to come with him to Dor Grestin
as he made some recent discovery on the forest moon. If you
agree or visit him later, he will tell you about a cave the
dwarf rangers found. You can now obtain the wasp riding tack
from Feldrar in the tavern (see "The nest" above). On the back
of a wasp you can fly straight southeast of the northern exit
of Dor Grestin and should reach some cave surrounded by plant
pillars. In there you meet Hudyn, a dwarf ranger, who worries
for his missing friend who is deeper inside the cave. You meet
Hudyn several times until you reach strange antique walls and
a door. Inside you will find an ancient elevator which brings
you downwards into an ancient vault. But on the way you have
to defeat the wasp queen which drops a powerful essence which
can be used to empower Kasimir even further. But this time
Sandra is not able to do it, but Dorina comes to the rescue.

In the ancient vault you have to solve several riddles and
prove your strength, dexterity and intelligence. At the end
you get a green orb which can be used in the Antique Area
level 4 to travel to a new world with the world teleporter.
You will also unlock a direct teleporter from the ancient
vault to the antique area.
